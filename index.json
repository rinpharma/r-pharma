BeiGene, Genentech, GSK, The Janssen Pharmaceutical Companies of Johnson \u0026amp; Johnson, Novartis, Pfizer, The Prostate Cancer Clinical Trials Consortium (PCCTC), Roche and Posit PBC the following topics are now on the agenda for our round tables (our attempt at paraphrasing these nuanced topics):\n Can we stop validating R packages internally, and build a pan-industry process? How can we help the path to interactive regulatory submissions? What\u0026rsquo;s needed to be more confident depending on externally governed packages? Can we combine our learnings on making a case for OS contributions? Where is the potential for impact with LLMs/AA/AI for both drug development, and data scientist efficiency? Where are we as data scientists and SCE developers on multi-modal, multi-disciplinary, drug development?  and probably the topic we are most excited about (especially with Roche and others attending, to discuss its SCE for CT/RWE and PHC) is\u0026hellip;\n What is a modern workflow? What are the key capabilities of a modern SCE? What can we learn from each other enabling diversity without compromising our SCE architecture - from legacy codebases/languages and their workflows built around mounted drives and unix permissions, through to multi-modal analyses querying multiple data stores via tokens as secrets, mixing not just open source languages, but different dockerfiles in a single analysis.  70 representatives from 42 companies will come together to tackle these and other questions.\nReview the agenda below, or visit the discussion link to see the proposed topics:\nhttps://rinpharma.github.io/positconf-roundtables-2023/\nhttps://github.com/rinpharma/positconf-roundtables-2023/discussions?discussions_q=is%3Aopen+label%3Aroundtable-topic\n","date":1694822400,"expirydate":-62135596800,"kind":"page","lang":"en","lastmod":1696296174,"objectID":"de1ff3c9c15cca85b404a3b6d04d1270","permalink":"/post/2023-09-16-summit/","publishdate":"2023-09-16T00:00:00Z","relpermalink":"/post/2023-09-16-summit/","section":"post","summary":"We're just a couple of days out from the R/Pharma round tables!","tags":null,"title":"R/Pharma Round Tables","type":"post"},{"authors":null,"categories":null,"content":"R/Pharma is excited to present a total of 16 workshops this year, hosted by members of our community.

The runtime of such workflows can be significantly longer than a Shiny app can practicably handle. In such situations, binding the execution of computational tasks with active browser sessions can be detrimental to the user experience, making both the tasks and the web application less reliable. We present a R based solution to accommodate long running workflows with asynchronous execution of background tasks. By utilizing functions from shiny, httr, plumber, and pins packages, one can construct scalable web applications capable of asynchronous processing that cover processing-block free task creation, execution, status query, and results retrieval.

A lot is being said about statistical programming (CDISC datasets, TFLs) with R and addressing validation issues. The most important players embraced R in various areas of their activity and share their experience, develop game-changing tools, and propose solutions. But the market consists also of small CROs, like ours, fully based on R, harnessing it in all areas of our statistical and programming work from the trial design, through creation of datasets, conducting planned and ad-hoc statistical analyses, generation of the TFLs, ending with the validation of both the outcomes and the R software itself. In the last 5 years of daily work with R, we gained a solid hands-on experience. Now we would like to share our story the problems we faced, the measures we tried and the solutions that have proven successful. We believe in the importance of sharing experience from diverse subjects, as small CROs have their own specificity, needs and possibilities in terms of budget and people.

RMarkdown’s ability to integrate both the code used to query the data, with the results and visualization of it, provides a more powerful interface in which the output can contain both the process and the results, unifying two procedures which are separate with other approaches to the QC process. We present our analytical QC pipeline process which can be developed at the start of a new project and marries the processes of deeply understanding the underlying data in the early stages, with developing an ongoing pipeline of reports and QC procedures which can be automated and run in the future when the data is refreshed. The reduced timeline of this process greatly increases the speed in which updated data can be ingested accurately and confidently, and results in key stakeholders having quick access to the most up to date information in downstream processes and decision making.","tags":["Johnson \u0026 Johnson"],"title":"RMarkdown for enhanced Quality Control \u0026 Documentation","type":"publication"},{"authors":["Eric Peña","Angela Samples","Farooq Sabir","Zheng Yang"],"categories":null,"content":"","date":1668038400,"expirydate":-62135596800,"kind":"page","lang":"en","lastmod":1668038400,"objectID":"0791760da4817ef5d18f85e68242001c","permalink":"/publication/rinpharma_286/","publishdate":"1999-01-01T00:00:00Z","relpermalink":"/publication/rinpharma_286/","section":"publication","summary":"RStudio is one of the most commonly used software integrated development environment (IDE) for R.

We’d like to share our approach, with special emphasis to the core design philosophies that we’ve set out to adhere to building a process that stays close to open source tools and contributing back where we can (github.com/Genentech/rd2markdown, github.com/Genentech/covtracer). Beyond what we’ve developed internally, we’d like to sit this work next to recent efforts by the R Validation Hub and offer a vision for a shared, public repository that can support transparent quality assessment. By doing this, we’d like to set the stage for further feedback and broader participation to ensure that the future of R package ecosystems is more immediately actionable and accessible across institutions and regulators.","tags":["Roche"],"title":"Roches approach to software validation: an automated pipeline from validation to publication","type":"publication"},{"authors":["Daniel Sabanés Bové"],"categories":null,"content":"","date":1667952000,"expirydate":-62135596800,"kind":"page","lang":"en","lastmod":1667952000,"objectID":"fa68844fe7ab17c70e2493ceba6d0b03","permalink":"/publication/rinpharma_270/","publishdate":"1999-01-01T00:00:00Z","relpermalink":"/publication/rinpharma_270/","section":"publication","summary":"Increasingly biostatisticians in pharma companies would like to use R on a daily basis, e.g. the growing number of participants in R/Pharma conferences is one metric showing this trend. As R programs replace proprietary software in this regulated industry, the requirements for quality and reliability increase, e.g. validation of packages might be required. More importantly, programs used in multiple projects or over a longer time period with changing biostatisticians need to be maintainable, intuitive and reliable. Getting this done takes experience and time. In particular, it is challenging to do this as a side project next to other daily biostatistics work and without the right tools in place. Therefore forming a dedicated team, working together closely with the applied biostatisticians, methods experts and IT professionals, can help. We share our Statistical Engineering team experience in Roche, covering agile ways of working, resourcing, product prioritization, and open source collaborations.

Safety endpoints have high variability, are multidimensional, and interrelated which points out to a need to identify novel approaches to explore, analyze, and present these data in some meaningful and insightful way. Visual analytics presents an alternative to the traditional tabular outputs for exploring, assessing, and reporting safety data and present an opportunity to enhance and facilitate evaluation of drug safety and help convey multiple pieces of information concisely and more effectively than tables. Graphical depictions of safety data can play a big role in facilitating communication of safety results with different stakeholders including regulators, investigators, and data monitoring committees. Visual analytics facilitates blending data visualization, statistical, and data mining techniques to create visualization modalities that help users make sense out of safety data with emphasis on how to complement computation and visualization to perform effective and meaningful analyses. Importantly, it is critical to develop readily available tools for stakeholders to use for visual analytics of drug safety data. The tools must take into account considerations revolving around structured assessment driven by safety questions of interest and should consider appropriate user interface parlor.

In implementing these plans, we experience random highs and lows in the data, adjacent doses of a drug with drastically different results, and lots and lots of uncertainty. To facilitate training in adaptive trials, newcomers need to see data as it might accumulate within a trial and attempt to make design decisions based on that data. To this end we have created ANTICS, a free public R/Shiny based tool that guides a user through a single adaptive trial. ANTICS has modules for dose escalation, dose finding, enrichment, and staged/seamless designs. Repeated plays of ANTICS introduce the idea of simulation and emphasize how the same rules can produce different results when faced with random data. ANTICS has modules for dose escalation, dose finding, enrichment, and staged/seamless designs. A scoring system guides the decision making, emphasizing real world incentives such as getting a correct arm into phase 3 or penalizing players for running a phase 3 in a poor arm.

Up until recently, one had to choose between R and SAS. Today, most statisticians are trained in both languages. With this in mind, at AstraZeneca we built on the growing interest for R, at any stage of the drug development but also company-wide. Since April 2021, we have launched several internal initiatives aiming at federating the community of R users within AstraZeneca. We started by stealing with pride a public initiative, TidyTuesdays, and make it our very own, calling it \u0026#35;azTidyTuesday. On a monthly basis, we promote a public dataset to the community of AstraZeneca R users. This is done by aligning the \u0026#35;azTidyTuesday editions with one AZ value or with an ongoing event (Pride Month, COP26). We also put in place monthly Lunch \u0026 Learns, interviews of R users and blog posts. And in early 2022, we organized the first AstraZeneca R Conference. While building this community, we tried many things. Some worked well from the beginning, some required improvements. But all of these initiatives bore fruit as the number of R community members saw a 5-fold increase since launch. More than the numbers, the vibrancy of the community is what makes us proud.","tags":["AstraZeneca"],"title":"Successfully building a vibrant community of R users at AstraZeneca: Lessons Learned!","type":"publication"},{"authors":["Christina Fillmore"],"categories":null,"content":"","date":1667865600,"expirydate":-62135596800,"kind":"page","lang":"en","lastmod":1667865600,"objectID":"4637e70e3310a7f83b9429e5db447369","permalink":"/publication/rinpharma_256/","publishdate":"1999-01-01T00:00:00Z","relpermalink":"/publication/rinpharma_256/","section":"publication","summary":"Tables no longer just live in flat PDFs and reports, but should be able to go from apps to PDFs and Word documents with ease. To have the flexibility to do this we need to separate the analysis from the formatting. Additionally, in the pharmaceutical industry our tables need to be able to change their format. Many journals have different requirements on how to present p-value, and other styling questions. So, we built a package devoted to the formatting of tables based on semi-structured analysis results datasets. This package is unique because it allows users to create tables without data, which helps build mock shells, a key part of table creation within pharma. Additionally, we wanted to be able to layer formats on top of each other as most tables in the industry are built to an internal standard, with minor tweaks around the edges. The code to create the shells can then be reused for the final tables, which saves time and brings table formatting off the critical path. Through the utilization of analysis results datasets, layerable and data-independent formatting, we’ve been able to create a package to meet the specific needs of our business.","tags":["GSK"],"title":"Why do I spend all my life formatting tables?!","type":"publication"},{"authors":null,"categories":null,"content":"R/Pharma 2021 experimented with panel discussions at the end of each conference day and we are delighted to announce that we\u0026rsquo;ll be bringing them back for R/Pharma 2022.\nThe panels will not be recorded.

Before the clinical study report is finalized a thorough interpretation of the results are needed and results are discussed with stakeholders and management. To facilitate this, a PowerPoint presentation is prepared containing tables and figures with study results. A modest approach is to manually copy-paste the tables and figures from the clinical study report into the slides. However, due to the manual work, this approach is both time consuming and prone to errors. Rmarkdown offers the possibility to render PowerPoint presentations and can thus be used as an alternative approach to automatic generate slide decks for communication of clinical study results, and we have been working with this idea at Novo Nordisk. The idea is to use the data that underlie tables and figures prepared for the clinical study report, and with a minor programming effort create outputs that are embedded into a PowerPoint presentation. We will discuss possibilities with this automatic approach and discuss issues encountered when implementing the approach when preparing for communication of a clinical study.","tags":["Novo Nordisk"],"title":"Automatic generation of PowerPoint presentation for communication of clinical trial results","type":"publication"},{"authors":["Afshin Mashadi-Hossein","Julie Rytlewski","Garth McGrath"],"categories":null,"content":"","date":1635984000,"expirydate":-62135596800,"kind":"page","lang":"en","lastmod":1635984000,"objectID":"a41917d008544c4b586620b22dda5cf0","permalink":"/publication/rinpharma_240/","publishdate":"1999-01-01T00:00:00Z","relpermalink":"/publication/rinpharma_240/","section":"publication","summary":"For data science teams, data preparation takes substantial investment of time, data science expertise and subject matter proficiency. However, as the name implies, data preparation is typically viewed merely as a means to an end, encouraging creation of expensive but often single-use and fragile elements in data analysis workflows. Rather than seeing data preparation as an obstacle to be removed, we propose a framework that recognizes the time and expertise invested in data preparation and seeks to maximize the value that can be derived from it. Viewing analysis-ready data as a multi-purpose, modularly built product that should lend itself to collaborative development and maintenance, the framework of Data-as-a-Product (DaaP) aims to remove barriers to version tracking and collaborative data development and maintenance. Specifically, the framework, which is entirely implemented in R, enables joint code and data versioning based on git, standardizes metadata capture, tracks R packages used, and encourages best practices such as adherence to functional programming and use of data testing. Collectively, the patterns established by the DaaP framework can help data science teams transition from developing expensive, single-use \"wrangled\" datasets to building maintainable, version-controlled, and extendable data products that could serve as reliable components of their data analyses workflows.","tags":["BMS"],"title":"Data-as-a-Product: A data science framework for data collaborations","type":"publication"},{"authors":["David Granjon"],"categories":null,"content":"","date":1635984000,"expirydate":-62135596800,"kind":"page","lang":"en","lastmod":1635984000,"objectID":"05ffc8e893612e7792d427d06aa859ec","permalink":"/publication/rinpharma_236/","publishdate":"1999-01-01T00:00:00Z","relpermalink":"/publication/rinpharma_236/","section":"publication","summary":"In recent years, R users' understanding of Shiny has greatly increased but so have client expectations.

Databases are analyzed worldwide with modern algorithms and entire industries are making data-driven decisions at an even faster pace. In Pharma, it is not enough to get the prediction (the what). The model must also explain how it came to the prediction (the why). ML models can only be debugged and audited when they can be interpreted, which then allows for fairness, robustness and trust. Presently, however, the amount, complexity, variety, and speed of clinical data runs the risk of leaving us knowing less about our compounds than regulatory bodies. While the capabilities of ML and AI have received much attention, their role in clinical development has now moved from the theoretical to practical application stage. Using industrialized ML/AI tools, can detect clinically relevant, highly complex safety/efficacy signals that are not identifiable via classical approaches that force hypotheses on the data. By deriving the best hypothesis given the data, ML is currently the best available methodology to create holistic mathematical models of complex (biological) systems using all available data and variables while complementing findings from classical approaches. We, the Biomarker \u0026 Data Insight Group at Bayer, have developed a MLAI pipeline in R. Our MLAI pipeline is comprised of four core-modules (data preprocessing, modeling / hyperparameter tuning, higher order interaction analysis and reporting) using most of the available data of late phase trails covering standard endpoint types (time-to-event, class and continuous.). Each core module has its own created internal R package integrating several R packages (e.g. tidyverse, tidymodels, mlr3, iml, Rmarkdown, Shiny,...). The pipeline is an industrialized, mature and validated software product with continuous delivery and continuous deployment. Something special about this pipeline is that we have the effort to open the \"black box\" using explainable AI. With these extra tools, we can understand better why a certain variable is relevant for the prediction, reveal the nature of its relationship (monotonic or non-monotonic) with the outcome, and make the ML results more understandable and meaningful for clinicians.","tags":["Bayer"],"title":"Industrialized Machine Learning and Explainable AI for Late Phase Trails","type":"publication"},{"authors":["Regis James"],"categories":null,"content":"","date":1635897600,"expirydate":-62135596800,"kind":"page","lang":"en","lastmod":1635897600,"objectID":"c9dff0854b4eae18afb5beb7e8656fc1","permalink":"/publication/rinpharma_217/","publishdate":"1999-01-01T00:00:00Z","relpermalink":"/publication/rinpharma_217/","section":"publication","summary":"In this talk, we will be discussing an architecturally and bioinformatically multi-layered integrative multiomic approach to the development of target hypotheses.  Scientists work to help pharmaceutical companies advance towards the identification of potent therapeutics on a daily basis.  In some scenarios, biological scientists can develop therapeutic tools without a specific target in mind.  In this case, they would like to generate a list of potential targets for their tools, within a given set of parameters for the delivery.  However, combing through all of the appropriate databases to find these targets that have the appropriate molecular biology characteristics, viable mouse models that recapitulate the human disease phenotypes, and pathologies in the tissues of interest, to generate this list is very difficult to perform manually.  This work requires making recursive decisions from the present wealth of biological literature and its data at scale.  Such decision-making is a herculean task that requires the simultaneous propagated joins of annotated entity catalogs (genes, knockout mice, diseases, structured vocabulary terms, etc.) and, orthogonally, recursive filtration of hierarchical associations between those entities and controlled biomedical vocabularies.  To streamline and accelerate this process, we used public data repositories (Uniprot, National Center for Biotechnology Information, International Mouse Phenotyping Consortium, Online Mendelian Inheritance in Man), ontologies (Gene Ontology, Mammalian Phenotype Ontology, Human Phenotype Ontology), and their multi-species (mouse, human) entity annotations to populate and index a MySQL relational database and a Neo4j graph database with their descriptive and relational properties.  We then built an API (application programming interface) via the plumber package for R to dynamically generate optimized SQL and Neo4j Cypher queries that interact with the MySQL database, via the RMariaDB package for R, and the Neo4j graph database, via the neo4r package for R, to fuse data across the ingested biomedical repository data and use the yielded results to generate parseable JSON objects.  Finally, we built a user-friendly shiny app for constructing and submitting queries via the API, parsing the JSON API outputs, and providing interactive network visualizations of the queries via the VisNet package for R, in-depth explanations of how the results were generated, and links to external resources for further relevant scientific data.  We delivered this app to fellow scientist collaborators via RStudio Connect, enabling these biologists to, within milliseconds, leverage high-dimensional, multi-species relationships to identify potential targets.","tags":["Regeneron"],"title":"Intermap: An integrative multiomics approach to generating therapeutic target hypotheses","type":"publication"},{"authors":["Robert Kirk DeLisle"],"categories":null,"content":"","date":1635897600,"expirydate":-62135596800,"kind":"page","lang":"en","lastmod":1635897600,"objectID":"5afb31851a737903e02ef84d974afaa5","permalink":"/publication/rinpharma_227/","publishdate":"1999-01-01T00:00:00Z","relpermalink":"/publication/rinpharma_227/","section":"publication","summary":"R and Python compose the fundamental tools used by data scientists across industries including pharma and biotech. With a rich set of analytical packages in both language domains, analysts who are able to work with both possess a significantly larger selection of tools in their toolbox compared to single language analysts. To consolidate these camps, the reticulate package has played a fundamental and critical role in enabling the direct use of Python from the R console. Additionally, integration of Python capabilities into the RStudio IDE allows single point of access to both languages and their integration. Once a Python module or class is imported, however, accessing methods and attributes from R requires the usage of the $ operator in a way that is not completely consistent with typical R code and creates challenges for integration of objects or models developed in both languages. The result can become a mixture of R-esque and Python-like code that can resemble two different language structures, despite the efforts to combine them. In order to provide analysts an environment in which Python modules and classes can be used as though they were R-native objects, SomaLogic developed the PyR package. This package consists of a set of Python classes that wrap Python objects and a set of S3 methods providing wrappers to those imported classes.

Briefly, drug repositioning refers to the systematic investigation of a novel disease indication for a drug molecule. Drug repositioning can be accelerated using various tools and technologies, including intelligent dashboards, data integration and human-in-the-loop machine learning.  A typical drug repositioning investigation generates a large amount that often needs to be linked and interpreted using a visual grammar familiar to various scientific groups leading drug repositioning investigation. We developed OneView - a shiny app that enables seamless integration, computing and visualization to accelerate drug repositioning investigations.  As in many clinical and pre-clinical projects, the problem that OneView tries to solve is to connect biologists and clinicians with the data in a meaningful way. The core data behind the dashboard are from an analysis comparing transcriptomic signatures of drug molecules with hundreds of disease transcriptomic signatures, creating connections between a compound and diseases based on an inverse correlation between the transcriptomic signatures. To fully understand the significance of the relationships, OneView provides a dynamic dashboard enabling scientists to filter/search within the data, follow connections through multiple datasets, and provide meaningful interactive visualizations.  We have incorporated additional data from several internal knowledge repositories to find further evidence to substantiate potential links between a compound and a disease.   From a technical aspect, the most challenging part has been visualizing the data in the best way. A lot of the interesting information is in the standard connections of different elements in the data - such as common genes in multiple mappings between compound and disease signatures. In many cases, network plots were too busy to display those connections meaningfully. Instead, UpSet plots were found the best way to visualize interactions between multiple sets. While several packages are implementing UpSet plots in R, none of them allowed for interactive visualizations. To allow interaction with the visualization and further drilling down the data by selecting bars in the graph, we implemented our version of UpSet plots using the JavaScript library D3.","tags":["Astra Zeneca"],"title":"OneView – A Shiny app to unlock the full potential of drug repositioning investigations","type":"publication"},{"authors":["David Benkeser"],"categories":null,"content":"","date":1635897600,"expirydate":-62135596800,"kind":"page","lang":"en","lastmod":1635897600,"objectID":"06195e952f74937acba063f265fbd9da","permalink":"/publication/rinpharma_229/","publishdate":"1999-01-01T00:00:00Z","relpermalink":"/publication/rinpharma_229/","section":"publication","summary":"(The) Operation (formally known as) Warp Speed is a joint venture between pharma and government to bring COVID-19 vaccines to market at unprecedented speed.

Our team was tasked with designing an analysis plan and the code needed to analyze the data and produce results that answered these key questions.

The iSEE (Interactive SummarizedExperiment Explorer) R/Bioconductor software package (https//bioconductor.org/packages/iSEE/), built on the shiny R framework, provides a general-purpose graphical interface for exploring any rectangular dataset with additional sample and feature annotations, such as single-cell RNA-seq data. Users can create, configure, and interact with the iSEE interface, enabling quick iterations of data visualization. This facilitates generation of new scientific hypotheses and insights into biological phenomena, and empowers a wide range of researchers to explore their data in depth. iSEE also guarantees the reproducibility of the analysis, by reporting the code generating all the output elements as well as the layout and configuration of the user interface. The combination of interactivity and reproducibility makes iSEE an ideal candidate to bridge and complement the expertise of researchers, who are able to design flexible, accessible, and robust dashboards that can also be directly shared and deployed in collaborative contexts - connecting large data collections to broad audiences, thus further increasing the value of generated research data.","tags":["Friedrich Miescher Institute"],"title":"Interactive and collaborative exploration of large-scale transcriptomics data with iSEE","type":"publication"},{"authors":["Yujie Zhao","Xuan Deng","Benjamin Wang","Yilong Zhang"],"categories":null,"content":"","date":1635811200,"expirydate":-62135596800,"kind":"page","lang":"en","lastmod":1635811200,"objectID":"4ae05968c08af56c94c0608ce45f056f","permalink":"/publication/rinpharma_205/","publishdate":"1999-01-01T00:00:00Z","relpermalink":"/publication/rinpharma_205/","section":"publication","summary":"In the safety analysis of clinical trials, the forest plot plays an important role.

First, users can apply filters to filter out the adverse event (AE) category of interest, for example, the serious AE, drug-related AE, AE with toxicity grade 3-5, etc... Second, the filtered AE summary tables can be downloaded as .rft files. Third, subject-level details can be drilled down by clicking the downward triangle bottom.

Following the framework introduced by the R validation hub (Nicholls et al., 2020), we started to develop an algorithm to qualify a CRAN package as a Merck standard package. In a nutshell If an R package passes the installation qualification and successfully executes available tests, the package will be made available to the user. Then, an automated risk assessment of R packages is performed based on the test coverage score (more is better) and the riskmetric score generated from the meta-information (smaller is better). If pre-defined thresholds are fulfilled, the package is qualified as Merck standard package, otherwise an explicit (manual) risk assessment is needed. In this presentation, we introduce our pathway to a risk-based assessment of R packages at Merck. We provide relevant details on the statistical analysis which led to the definition of thresholds supporting a robust classification of CRAN packages as Merck standard packages.

However, unmeasured confounding stemming from non-randomized treatments and poorly measured comorbidities remains the greatest obstacle to utilizing these data sources for real-world evidence generation. To reduce unmeasured confounding, data-driven algorithms can be used to leverage the large volume of information in healthcare databases to identify proxy variables for confounders that are either unknown to the investigator or not directly measured in these data sources (proxy confounder adjustment). Evidence has shown that data-driven algorithms for proxy confounder adjustment can supplement investigator-specified variables to improve confounding control compared to adjustment based on investigator-specified variables alone. Consequently, there has been a recent explosion in the development of data-driven methods for high-dimensional proxy confounder adjustment. In this talk, I will discuss recent advancements in data-driven methods for high-dimensional proxy confounder adjustment and their implementation within the R computing environment. I will discuss challenges in assessing the validity of alternative analytic choices to tailor analyses to the given study to improve validity and robustness when estimating treatment effects in healthcare databases.","tags":["Harvard University"],"title":"Automated Data-Adaptive Analytics to Improve Robustness of Confounding Control when Estimating Treatment Effects in Electronic Healthcare Databases","type":"publication"},{"authors":["Dariusz Ratman"],"categories":null,"content":"","date":1602720000,"expirydate":-62135596800,"kind":"page","lang":"en","lastmod":1602720000,"objectID":"4d92e7997e556e5b5120d4c9c4b00655","permalink":"/publication/rinpharma_177/","publishdate":"1999-01-01T00:00:00Z","relpermalink":"/publication/rinpharma_177/","section":"publication","summary":"R and Biocondutor are important tools supporting scientific workflows across early Research and Development at Roche/Genentech.

Julia has been in development for over 11 years. Research on Julia originated at MIT in 2009. Julia is powered by multiple dispatch - a generalization of both, object oriented programming and functional programming. Julia's multiple dispatch makes it easy to write programs at a high level of abstraction while simultaneously getting high performance. This has led to Julia being used by over 10,000 companies and 1,500 universities worldwide. Pumas, developed in Julia, integrates mechanistic pharmacometric models with Scientific Machine Learning and neural networks. In a recent case study, we demonstrated 175x speedup for a QSP workload. Pumas is designed for every type of analysis scientists perform throughout the drug development lifecycle in one seamless environment. Leveraging Julia's parallel capabilities, Pumas leverages distributed computing and GPUs and runs on the cloud through the JuliaHub platform.

The ability to produce tables, listings and figures (TLFs) in customized rich text format (RTF) using R is crucial to enhance the workflow of using Microsoft Word to assemble analysis results. We developed an R package, r2rtf, that standardizes the approach to generate highly customized TLFs in RTF format. The r2rtf package provides flexibility to customize table appearance for table title, subtitle, column header, footnote, and data source. The table size, border type, color, and line width can be adjusted in each cell as well as column width, row height, text format, font size, text color, alignment, etc. The control of the format can be row or column vectorized by leveraging the vectorization in R. Furthermore, r2rtf provides pagination, section grouping, multiple tables concatenations for complicated table layouts. In this paper, we provide an overview r2rtf workflow with examples for both required and optional easy-to-use functions.

As part of characterising these models, DNA sequencing technology and bioinformatics analyses are used systematically to study their genomes. Therefore, large volumes of data are generated and various algorithms are applied to analyse this data, which introduces a challenge on representing all findings in an informative and concise manner. Scientific visualisation can be used to facilitate the explanation of complex genomic editing events such as integration events, deletions, insertions, etc. However, current visualization tools tend to focus on numerical data, ignoring the need to visualise editing events on a larger yet biologically-relevant scale. Thus, we have developed gmoviz, an R package designed to extend traditional bioinformatics workflows used for genomic characterization with powerful visualization capabilities based on the Circos plotting framework. The circular layout used in gmoviz's plots enables users to succinctly display genome-wide information about complex genomic editing events along with contextual biological information to improve the interpretation of findings. The gmoviz package has been developed by utilizing the many features of the Bioconductor ecosystem in order to support several genomic file formats and to seamlessly generate publication-quality figures. Finally, a complex transgenic mouse model, which harbours human gene knock-in, gene knock-outs, segmental insertion, deletion and concatemerisation events, has been used to illustrate the functionality of gmoviz.","tags":["CSL"],"title":"Seamless Visualisation of Complex Genomic Variations in GMOs and Edited Cell Lines Using gmoviz","type":"publication"},{"authors":["Sophie Sun"],"categories":null,"content":"","date":1602720000,"expirydate":-62135596800,"kind":"page","lang":"en","lastmod":1602720000,"objectID":"36c2a6bba466b958d499958f46f1206d","permalink":"/publication/rinpharma_181/","publishdate":"1999-01-01T00:00:00Z","relpermalink":"/publication/rinpharma_181/","section":"publication","summary":"Identification of subgroups with increased or decreased treatment effect is a challenging topic with several traps and pitfalls.

Programmers write a lot of reports that describe the results of data analyses. There should be a clear and automatic path from data and code to the final report. R Markdown is ideal for this as it is a system for combining code and text into a single document. It is also an efficient, user-friendly tool for producing reports that do not need constant updating. RStudio is often used in the Pharmaceutical and Healthcare industries for analysis and data visualization, and the R Markdown tool can also be leveraged for creating reports and datasets for submission to regulatory agencies. This paper presents an RStudio program that demonstrates how to use R Markdown to generate a statistical table showing adverse events (AE) by system organ class (or preferred term) and severity grade along with text that explains the table. Collecting AE data and performing analysis of AEs is a common and critical part of Clinical Trials.

With millions of screaming fans and selling over 600 million records, they are often cited as one of the most influential rock bands in history. One reason for their fame was their ability to communicate in the middle of songs without using words and without missing a single beat. This led me to consider some of the best collaborations I have been a part of, which are those where the team is in complete alignment and information flows easily from one team member to another. As analysts, it is our job to enhance the ability of teams to communicate with the best tool at our disposal; graphics. Just like Paul and John, our graphics need to communicate without speaking to convey information and help teams make critical decisions about clinical trials. Novartis leverages the potential of R - Shiny to develop interactive tools that engage users to explore their clinical trial data with ease. Although several programs have been impacted with this technology, the goal of reaching the entire drug development portfolio is still a work in progress. This talk will describe our experiences with R - Shiny with some examples. Finally, it should be stressed that creating effective Shiny Apps requires thought, as well as adherence to strong graphical principles.

These studies often require similar analyses to be repeated multiple times on replicates or different sample types. The results of these analyses need to be stored in data structures that are easily accessible to the lead analyst as well as additional team members responsible for validating the work. Nested data frames are a powerful and flexible data structures that are well suited for these requirements. This talk will show how storing all of the steps of an analysis pipeline in a nested data frame allows analysts to utilize the well-established functionality of the tidyverse family of packages for efficient analysis and summarization of the data. It will also discuss how nested data frames are well suited for reproducibility and traceability, which are vital to documenting analytical performance. Reproducibility is often achieved by writing R notebooks in an environment that maintains package version consistency (e.g. docker, RStudio Server). Using nested data frames as the underlying data structure within these frameworks provides a transparent and modular method for storing the results of an existing analysis and providing easily accessible data for downstream analysis.","tags":["Glaxosmithkline"],"title":"Clinical Reporting Using R at GSK","type":"publication"},{"authors":["Julia Silge"],"categories":null,"content":"","date":1602633600,"expirydate":-62135596800,"kind":"page","lang":"en","lastmod":1602633600,"objectID":"5663d1d8015eaadbf3117da52513f1ff","permalink":"/publication/rinpharma_153/","publishdate":"1999-01-01T00:00:00Z","relpermalink":"/publication/rinpharma_153/","section":"publication","summary":"Visual representations of data inform how machine learning practitioners think, understand, and decide.

Due to the ease of development of Shiny apps and lack of complex examples, R developers often create a new shiny app in a single app.r file that contains both the ui and server code/ As a project grows, and capabilities expand in the app, a common practice is to separate the code into two files, one for the server object and one for the ui object. While these approaches may suffice for simple applications, they can lead a developer or team of developers down a path to an application with many lines of code (e.g. 15,000+) in a single file that can be extremely difficult to debug, test, maintain or expand. This approach can also lead to a file with a mixture of UI/server related code in the same files as complex computational code. In this talk, I will present the  PREP  (Packages fRom tEmPlates) package that was created to help teams streamline development of R Shiny apps and R packages using an approach that follows software development best practices. The PREP package adds new project types to R Studio to help streamline new project creation and development. There are three PREP project type options 1) a Shiny app as a package, 2) a Shiny app or 3) R package that is setup with the unit testing framework included utilizing  testthat  and is intended to contain all the complex computational functionality. Both Shiny app options are organized using modules with a consistent default theme, ability to switch between color theme options and example code for commonly implemented tasks. By developing the complex computations in the R packages and the Shiny app as separate projects, teams can utilize each person's skill set better and simplify the testing thus making a more robust final product.

Several rounds of iterations between the main programmer and the validation programmer are usually needed to thoroughly explore the data. Furthermore, clinicians and statisticians often would like to explore the data themselves but lack a robust and flexible platform to carry out this data exploration. For instance, they may need to inspect an endpoint for patients with certain genetic markers, to analyze biomarker data, or to create table summaries. To meet these needs, we created tidyCDISC, an open source Shiny application that can be used to generate custom tables, statistics, and figures. The application has three modules a drag and drop table generator, a graphical population explorer, and a patient history explorer. We've taken a modularized approach to our package to ensure the application can be easily expanded upon to include further analyses and figures.

For many of the tables that go into a clinical submission, at least when considering safety outputs, the tables are made up of a combination of these approaches. Consider a demographics table. When you look at the table, you can begin breaking the output down into smaller, redundant, components.

Greater understanding of current trends in prescription opioid utilization may help prevent new cases of abuse, addiction, and overdose. The U.S. Food and Drug Administration (FDA, the Agency) is expanding its capacity for proactive pharmacovigilance of drug abuse, in addition to other drug safety signals. In post-market safety surveillance, pharmacy dispensing data provide valuable insights to the Agency for oversight of drug utilization. The drug dispensing data include the number of product dispensings aggregated over a time frame (e.g., months) by geographical locations (e.g., states, core-based statistical areas). One promising approach to enhance pharmacovigilance using these data would be through data enrichment geographically referenced public data sources covering detailed information on demographic, socioeconomic, and healthcare service can be overlaid to proprietary, nationally projected data for prescription drug dispensing. Our project, funded by the Center for Drug Evaluation and Research (CDER) Safety Research Interest Group (SRIG) program, seeks to develop a data analysis pipeline and software for generating real-world evidence (RWE) that will monitor changes in prescription opioid use and guide proactive pharmacovigilance of drug abuse. The software will provide tools to augment proprietary, nationally projected data for prescription drug dispensing with other geographically referenced, publicly available, demographic, socioeconomic, or healthcare service data. The software will generate RWE including user-interactive data visualization, spatio-temporal modeling, and machine learning for identifying factors potentially associated with drug utilization, misuse, and abuse.","tags":["FDA"],"title":"geoMapr: A Shiny Application for Enriched Analysis of Drug Utilization Data","type":"publication"},{"authors":["Daniel Sabanés Bové"],"categories":null,"content":"","date":1602547200,"expirydate":-62135596800,"kind":"page","lang":"en","lastmod":1602547200,"objectID":"263d9ee158f3226055bf5d4b0fb39c32","permalink":"/publication/rinpharma_142/","publishdate":"1999-01-01T00:00:00Z","relpermalink":"/publication/rinpharma_142/","section":"publication","summary":"MMRMs are often used as the primary analysis of continuous endpoints in longitudinal clinical trials (see e.g. Mallinckrod et al, 2008). Essentially, an MMRM is a specific linear mixed effects model that includes (at least) an interaction of treatment arm and categorical visit variables as fixed effects. The covariance structure of the residuals can have different forms, and often an unstructured (i.e. saturated parametrization) covariance matrix is preferred. This structure can be represented by random effects in the mixed model. All of this has typically been implemented in proprietary software, such as SAS, as its PROC MIXED routine is generally seen as a gold standard for mixed models. However, this does not allow the use of interactive web applications to explore the clinical study data in a flexible way. Furthermore, fitting such proprietary software into workflows such as automatic document generation is not convenient. Therefore, we wanted to implement MMRM in R. Several challenges had to be solved, such as finding the right R-packages for this purpose. We finally settled on  lme4  in combination with  lmerTest , which could match results in SAS up to numerical precision. Convergence of estimates can be an issue and multiple optimization algorithms are therefore tried in parallel to enhance robustness. Extracting the covariance matrix estimate from  lme4  results was solved as well as finding model fit statistics that match SAS results. We use our own  rtables  to produce tables and  ggplot2  for plots. We developed a Shiny module in our internal framework for exploratory web applications. Further validation in the next months will allow us to use the R implementation for regulatory purposes, with greater flexibility and efficiency than before.","tags":["Roche / Genentech"],"title":"Implementing Mixed Models with Repeated Measures (MMRM) in R and Shiny for Regulatory Purposes","type":"publication"},{"authors":["Laure Cougnaud","Michela Pasetto","Arne de Roeck"],"categories":null,"content":"","date":1602547200,"expirydate":-62135596800,"kind":"page","lang":"en","lastmod":1602547200,"objectID":"e5d41f3a8cf1c99f5c195b55f2766140","permalink":"/publication/rinpharma_141/","publishdate":"1999-01-01T00:00:00Z","relpermalink":"/publication/rinpharma_141/","section":"publication","summary":"Medical oversight during a clinical trial is an extensive and time-consuming process.

Individual attempts to fulfil validation requirement and bring R to the controlled environments were made by a number of companies independently. In addition, combined efforts of the biggest pharmaceutical companies resulted in launching the R Validation Hub project. While most of the initiatives seem to focus on documentation and package quality assessment, relying on the results of unit tests delivered \"as is\" by the authors of R packages, we at 2KMM CRO set different priorities, driven by the importance of exhaustive numerical validation done in the first place. Without that, there is a risk that all the efforts on documentation and quality assurance will pertain to routines which results differ from those obtained with other trusted software in a way that cannot be adequately justified. While we do not undermine the importance of documentation and early unit testing, we believe that numerical validation, going far beyond running those tests, is mandatory to achieve satisfying level of reliability.

Maintaining a validated code base that is rigid in its output format, but flexible enough to cater a variety of inputs with minimal custom coding has proven to be important for reproducibility and scalability. SCHARP has developed several key steps in the creation, validation, and documentation of R packages that take advantage of R's packaging functionality. First, the programming team works with leadership to define specifications and lay out a roadmap of the package at the functional level. Next, statistical programmers work together to develop the package, taking advantage of the rich R ecosystem of packages for development such as roxygen2, devtools, usethis, and testthat. Once the code has been developed, the package is validated to ensure it passes all specifications using a combination of testthat and rmarkdown. Finally, the package is made available for use across the team on live data.

A single round of statistical computation can take several minutes, hours, or even days to complete. The targets R package keeps results up to date and reproducible while minimizing the number of expensive tasks that actually run. Targets learns how your pipeline fits together, skips costly runtime for steps that are already up to date, runs the rest with optional implicit parallel computing, abstracts files as R objects, and shows tangible evidence that the output matches the underlying code and data. In other words, the package saves time while increasing our ability to trust the conclusions of the research. Targets surpasses the most burdensome permanent limitations of its predecessor, drake, to achieve greater efficiency and provide a safer, smoother, friendlier user experience. This hands-on workshop teaches targets using a realistic case study. Participants begin with the R implementation of a machine learning project, convert the workflow into a targets-powered pipeline, and efficiently maintain the output as the code and data change.

In 2018 and 2019 the conference was held in the Tsai Auditorium at the Center for Government and International Studies, Harvard University and capped at 150 attendees. The conference was run as a free event. Invitations were based on committee membership and advisory support, speaker acceptance, academic/student and diversity.\nThe conference has been run with single track consisting of keynotes from renowned industry practitioners to key R developers to leading academics. In addition there were a number of pre-conference workshops and full-length presentations as well as a number of shorter, highly-energetic lightning talks.\nIn 2020 we took a hiatus from holding the meeting at Harvard and ran a virtual conference. Over 1100 people registered for the three day virtual event that was preceded by a week of 11 workshops.\nFollowing the success of the 2020 event the organizing committee decided to hold a virtual event for the 2021 meeting. 2000 people registered for the three day event which included three panel discussion groups on the areas of validation, training and leadership and scaling shiny. In addition, we held 14 workshops around the conference dates.\nIn 2022 we will be running a virtual event again.\nOur entire event is a community-lead effort and 100% volunteer run. The event is vendor neutral and very much an academic conference. Harvard has been very helpful in hosting the event.\nThe R/Pharma conference is an event focused on the use of R in the development of pharmaceuticals. The conference covers topics including reproducible research, regulatory compliance and validation, safety monitoring, clinical trials, drug discovery, research \u0026amp; development, PK/PD/pharmacometrics, genomics, diagnostics, immunogenicity and more. All are discussed within the context of using R as a primary tool within the drug development process. The conference showcases the current use of R that is helping to drive biomedical research, drug discovery \u0026amp; development, and clinical initiatives.

In this context, the R admin is often confronted with a cohort of packages without knowing the package of interest. We use statistical analysis techniques from the field of complex network analysis in order to shed light into the non-trivial dependency structures of package cohorts. Furthermore, we simplify the network graph to find improved installation sequences for a pre-selected cohorts of R packages. We reduce large package cohorts to a sufficient shortlist of packages, whose installation automatically pulls in other packages via dependencies without causing conflicts. The build time of a library may be greatly reduced. As a byproduct, we generate a graph of the build on the exact dependency tree and actual versions used for auditing and change control in the regulated workflows.

Methods ModViz POP has an in built PKPD ODE library of models based on the compartmental nomenclature for simulating standard IV bolus, infusion and first order absorption scenarios. It also gives the user the ability to plug in a model from local directory to quickly simulate a model of interest. Users can also simulate from a project library which serves as a repository of final PK/PD models developed by individual project teams. Beyond the PK/PD models, it can handle complex QSP models and PBPK models equally well. Enhanced R packages, HTML/CSS, LATEX in combination with Shiny were used and provided an elegant and powerful programming framework for turning models into a web application with dynamic visualization and automated report writing. The user interface consists of several key inputs for performing the simulations. A tabbed navigation allows the user to visualize the plots, input parameters, derived values and equations. It provides the ability to download the underlying model, plots, simulated data or a comprehensive report consisting of all the key inputs and outputs of the simulations. The Help button provides a link to documentation with detailed instructions on different components of the interface. The interface also includes advanced features where users can overlay external data on over simulated data, set a certain simulation scenario as a reference or carry out sensitivity analysis based simulations. Conclusions This easy to use interface can serve as a valuable tool for teams to explore and evaluate potential scenarios and thus facilitate collaborative decision making in the drug discovery and development paradigm.

However, most PBPK applications have limited knowledge sharing impact because they are implemented in closed, proprietary software. Much of the physiologic data and knowledge required for these models is publically available or available in the pre-competitive space. To this end, we've engaged in the development of open science PBPK models, using R as the scaffolding for this work. In particular, our group has developed the mrgsolve R package which utilizes Rcpp to compile models of systems of ordinary differential equations. One example is the development of a PBPK model to predict maternal/fetal exposures for drugs that are primarily metabolized by liver CYP450 enzymes throughout pregnancy. This model aims to utilize a quantitative understanding of the physiological and biochemical changes that occur throughout pregnancy to inform clinical pharmacology decisions where clinical trials cannot. The model was validated against the observed data of 5 different drugs midazolam, metoprolol, caffeine, nevirapine, and artemether. A series of local sensitivity analyses followed by parameter optimization further improved model predictions using the mrgsolve and nloptr R packages. The developed maternal-fetal PBPK model in its flexible open-source implementation provides a transparent, platform-independent, and reproducible system for model-informed decision support while developing exposure-based dosing recommendations in maternal/fetal patient populations.","tags":["Metrum Research Group"],"title":"Prediction of maternal-fetal exposures of CYP450-metabolized drugs using physiologic pharmacokinetic modeling implemented in R and mrgsolve","type":"publication"},{"authors":["Carson Sievert"],"categories":null,"content":"","date":1566432000,"expirydate":-62135596800,"kind":"page","lang":"en","lastmod":1566432000,"objectID":"f5a512b72335c1c5dbc630245518c0ab","permalink":"/publication/rinpharma_112/","publishdate":"1999-01-01T00:00:00Z","relpermalink":"/publication/rinpharma_112/","section":"publication","summary":"Shiny makes it easy to take domain logic from an existing R script and wrap some reactive logic around it to produce an interactive webpage where others can quickly explore different variables, parameter values, models/algorithms, etc. Although the interactivity is great for many reasons, once an interesting result is found, it's more difficult to prove the correctness of the result since (1) the result can only be (easily) reproduced via the Shiny app and (2) the relevant domain logic which produced the result is obscured by Shiny's reactive logic.

On the other hand, Shiny apps are also transforming discovery research by putting powerful data wrangling, visualization and reporting tools into the hands of bench scientists. To solve the aforementioned problems in drug discovery research, we developed a suite of tools using Shiny to automate data wrangling, integration, visualization and reporting. Examples will be presented in areas such as automated signal processing and batch analysis of electrocardiogram data, collection and visualization of biomarker and physiology measurements from pharmacology studies, and access to a high performance computation cluster for non-experts.

Compared to rule/algorithm-based designs such as the 3+3 design, model-based designs have the advantage of being more flexible in choosing the target toxicity rate and cohort size. Bayesian modeling allows to combine prior knowledge of the drug (e.g. from animal tox studies, data from comparator drugs or data from other studies) with the observed data from the current trial. The model-based approach accounts for uncertainty, optimize dose recommendations (balance of risk versus benefit for patients) and allows for dose de-escalation as well as dose re-escalation. Recent research has shown that model-based approaches are more reliable in estimating the maximum tolerated dose (MTD) and allocating less patients to ineffective or excessively toxic doses (Jaki et al., 2019 [2]). Because of their higher complexity, model-based designs are still seen critical among clinicians (Le Tourneau et al., 2012 [3]), thus the classical 3+3 design is still widely implemented due to its simplicity and transparency. Conaway et al., 2019 [4] have highlighted that the choice of design in early phase affects the outcome of the drug development process, therefore more attention should be paid to early-stage designs. In this talk we will showcase how we bring Bayesian dose-escalation models closer to non-statisticians by means of R. We will discuss how we plan, implement and communicate the dose-escalation design to the clinicians. Moreover, we show how we present our results to the safety monitoring committee (SMC) and how we support the SMC in dose escalation decisions. We use a simple data example to illustrate the proposed methodology. All will be discussed within the context of using R as primary tool. [1] Iasonos, A. and O'Quigley, J (2014).

Part of SCHARP's work involves analyzing experimental biomarkers and endpoints which change as the experimental question, analysis methods, antigens measured, and assays evolve. Maintaining a validated code base that is rigid in its output format, but flexible enough to cater a variety of inputs with minimal custom coding has proven to be important for reproducibility and scalability. SCHARP has developed several key steps in the creation, validation, and documentation of R packages that take advantage of R's packaging functionality. First, the programming team works with leadership to define specifications and lay out a roadmap of the package at the functional level. Next, statistical programmers work together and approach the task from a software development view. Once the code has been developed, the package is validated according to procedures that comply with 21 CFR part 11, and leverage software development life cycle (SDLC) methodology.

This can happen due to tight timelines, lack of ready-to-use graphic tools or enthusiasm for complex models. Exploratory plots can help to uncover useful insights in the data and identify aspects to be explored further through modeling or in future studies. Exploratory plots can even quickly answer questions without the need of a complex model, improving our efficiency and providing timely impact on project strategy. The Exploratory Graphics (xGx) tool is an open-source R-based tool, freely available on GitHub [1]. Intuitively organized by datatype and driven by analysis questions, the tool aims to encourage a question-based approach to data exploration focusing on the key questions relevant to dose-exposure-response analyses. Objectives - Facilitate the purposeful exploration of PKPD data - Encourage a question-based approach to data exploration, focusing on dose-exposure-response relationships - Provide a teaching tool for people new to PKPD analysis Methods PK (single and multiple ascending dose), and PD (continuous, time-to-event, categorical, count, and ordinal) data were simulated and formatted according to a typical PKPD modeling dataset format. Lists of key questions relevant to dose-exposure-response exploration were compiled, and exploratory plots were generated to answer each question. The graphs were created following good graphics principles to ensure quality and consistency in our graphical communications [2]. Results Examples of the key analysis questions include - Provide an overview of the data - What type of data is it (e.g. continuous, binary, categorical)? - How many doses? - What is the range of doses explored? - For PK data, how many potential compartments are observed? - Is the exposure dose-proportional? - Is there evidence of nonlinearity in clearance? - Assess the variability - How large is the between subject variability compared to between dose separation? - Can any of the between subject variability be attributed to any covariates? - Are there any patterns in the within subject variability (e.g. circadian rhythms, seasonal effects, food effects, underlying disease progression)? - Assess the dose/exposure-response relationship - Is there evidence of a correlation between dose/exposure and response? - Is the relationship positive or negative? - Is there a plateau or maximal effect in the observed dose/exposure range? - Is there evidence of a delay between exposure and response? For each datatype in the simulated dataset, plots were generated to answer these key questions. The plots along with the codes to produce them were compiled into a user friendly interface. The tool is intuitively organized by datatype and driven by the analysis questions. Since the graphs were generated based on a typical modeling dataset format and hosted online, they can be easily accessed and applied to new projects. Conclusion Exploratory plots were generated, built around typical key questions particularly relevant to dose-exposure-response exploration and compiled into a user friendly interface. The Exploratory Graphics (xGx) tool can help underscore the role of purposeful data exploration for quantitative scientists. Through a question-based approach, xGx helps uncover useful insights that can be revealed without complex modeling and identify aspects of the data that may be explored further.

A growing, vibrant group of statisticians in the Office of Biostatistics, CDER/FDA has adopted R for both their routine tasks and to address numerous scientific questions that are received in the form of internal consults. During the past 5 years, we have used R to run power simulations; generate the distribution of certain statistics of interest; assess the similarity of and cluster amino-acid sequences as well as, derive the distribution of the molecular weight of such sequences of a certain length; and determine the validity of data sets categorized for genotoxicity. R-package SABE was developed to accompany a new statistical test, used to assess BE of topical dermatological products when data for evaluation come from the In-Vitro Permeation Test (IVPT) [1].

Big money placed on long-shot bets for block-buster drugs where being first makes all the difference means a constant struggle to gain a competitive edge. So, you might find it surprising that the inaugural R / Pharma Conference held this past August on the Harvard campus in a very classy auditorium was all about collaboration.\nSome might also find it surprising that data scientists from competitive companies would gather to share information, but this is quite common. I have seen it before in other competitive industries, for example in IEEE-led standards initiatives, where engineers gather to forge a common technology. Not only is there the human need to share and learn from peers (and also brag a little), there is a larger force at play: a kind of market clearing operation where experts gather to gain as much of an advantage as they can by ensuring that no easily exploitable arbitrage opportunities remain.\nIt was a surprise, though (and I think a source of general amusement as the conference proceeded), that nearly every talk seemed to be about Shiny. Looking back, it is clear that it should not have been: 49% of the abstracts explicitly mention Shiny. This word cloud was built from the abstract submissions.\n  Abstract wordcloud.  Shiny is basically a technology for sharing complex information across multiple organizations and stakeholders with different skill sets. Shiny, too, is all about collaboration. For a look into the large, production-grade Shiny app, bioWARP, see Sebastian Wolf’s recent post.\nOther major themes addressed at the conference were: reproducible research, package administration, scaling R for production, and using R in a regulatory environment. This last theme was underscored by a strong FDA presence. Lilliam Rosario from the FDA Center for Drug Evaluation \u0026amp; Research delivered the opening keynote, in which she addressed the regulatory role of CDER and the use of R. FDA speaker Mat Souktup spoke about the need to transcend the compartmentalized culture common in medical research, and how open-source tools are helpful in working towards this goal. He explicitly noted along the way that the FDA does not specify what software may be used. The third FDA speaker, Paul Schuette, filled in some details associated with topics raised by Rosario and talked about the use of R and Shiny at CDER. Along these same lines, Andy Nicholls from GSK conducted a well-attended and very informative workshop on The Challenges of Validating R. You can find Andy’s slides here.\nOther keynote speakers were Max Kuhn, who talked about Modeling in the tidyverse (slides here); Joe Cheng, who described how to use Shiny responsibly in pharma (slides here); and Michael Lawrence, who spoke about enabling open-source analytics in the enterprise.\nMy very biased impression was that R / Pharma was an unqualified success at accomplishing the major objectives of bringing together data scientists and statisticians working in the Pharmaceutical industry, and of presenting a high quality program that explored several issues relating to the production use of R in a regulatory environment.\nThe following chart shows that representatives from quite a few pharmaceutical companies attended in spite of organization problems that artificially limited the overall number of attendees to about 140.\n  Attendees.

With input from experienced practitioners, we have built an interactive tool to allow individuals to build complex recruitment models using the R/Shiny framework. The Tool Enhance R, our platform for study modeling, was ported from an Excel-based tool to the R/Shiny platform to increase model development speed, expand capability and drive transparency into model development. The tool allows users to specify critical model attributes (i.e. country site distribution, recruitment/activation rates, country-specific vacations), and provide instantaneous feedback that changes have on a model’s probability of success. Using the RStudio Connect platform, we are able to grant multi-level access to users through a single web interface. Model development is tracked by exporting results to a SharePoint site and logging versions for future review/auditing. This gives significant levels of transparency on how a model was created and evolved over time. For web analytics, we used Piwik, and internal web analytics platform, to monitor how users navigate through the platform and identify browsing behavior. The application was built upon the Shiny Dashboard framework and leverages many visualization packages, including Plotly, Timevis, ggplot2 and many more. Many challenges arose in its develop, from controlling over-zealous user clicks causing out of control execution, to integrating service account execution of apps to facilitate centralized data control.

Unfortunately, often an analysis cannot be reproduced and therefore its computational methodology and merit are unknown. Often, the data, code, or description of computational methods is not maintained. In order to implement good practices of reproducible computational research, the leadership of the company must invest time and resources into planning, training, ensuring adoption of common practices and tools, implementing documentation systems, encouraging discipline on the individual and group level, creating incentives, and requiring accountability. At Eisai, we have developed a working system for reproducible computational research that is enabled by leadership, technology, and culture. With regards to technology, we primarily use Rmarkdown and R Notebooks on an Rstudio server used by all our analysts. The Rstudio server is maintained by an administrator who installs packages for all users, creating a common package environment that ensures that code can be rerun in the future. Data and code are stored in a shared network drive and version control is accomplished by using Git. A wiki that is editable by all analysts is used to organize all analyses (tracked with unique analysis IDs) and provides links to code and results. With regards to culture, the leadership has promoted the values of quality and reproducibility. When yearly objectives are set, the performance criteria includes the creation of analysis documents (e.g. Rmarkdown reports), use of version control, and organization of data on shared network drives. Setting aside time for wiki documentation in the midst of high demands from project teams is helped by having periodic “documentation day” parties. To verify reproducibility, we have implemented \"witnessing\" once the analysis is finished, it is reviewed by an independent team member who officially signs off on the work, stating that the reproducibility criteria have been met.

However, there was no method or software available in-house to support Ab discovery with capacities to apply biophysical rules to classify the sequences.

A method was developed to evaluate differences between comparable sequences and subsequently classify sequences into families. The app provides custom-made and interactive data visualization, enables refined Ab classification in a mathematical manner, considerably increases efficiency and insures reproducibility.

This challenge is faced by any organization seeking to deliver modern pharmaceutical compounds to patients in a prompt manner. In this presentation, we highlight the incorporation of data science approaches using R to develop metrics that aid in the development process current complexity, risk quantification, and process efficiency forecasting. Current complexity is a metric established from human insights that assesses a molecule’s complexity in the context of capability, tracking the ‘current’ complexity of a given molecule over time and enabling the quantitative assessment of a new route or process. Risk quantification utilizes a Bayesian framework to quantify risk from real data and operational patterns, at both the project and portfolio level, for assessing the delivery risk of early candidate nomination assets in areas such as FTE resource modeling. Process efficiency can be estimated with a predictive analytics framework capable of quantifying the probable efficiency of a proposed synthesis or benchmarking the outcome performance of the developed process, thereby minimizing the environmental impact of pharmaceutical production.

However, the methods used to create bacterial strain libraries have seen little innovation in nearly 80 years. Current practice relies entirely on colony morphology and/or 16S rRNA gene sequencing analysis to decide which isolated strains to retain for addition to a drug discovery library. However, these practices create inefficient libraries plagued with a high degree of taxonomic and chemical redundancy by relying on physical characteristics that have limited correlation with strains’ SM, the foundation of drug discovery. Therefore, the development of a platform to rapidly prioritize unknown bacterial strains based on phylogeny and SM would greatly increase the efficiency of the front-end of microbial drug discovery. Our lab has recently developed such a platform, called IDBac, which uses in situ matrix-assisted laser desorption/ionization time-of-flight mass spectrometry (MALDI-TOF MS) to analyze protein and specialized metabolite spectra of single bacterial colonies. Utilizing R and Shiny, alongside state-of-the-art packages and techniques in MALDI processing and data visualization, we created a stand-alone executable program for MALDI-TOF MS bacterial analysis. Using unsupervised learning methods and visualizations we have demonstrated IDBac’s capabilities by creating protein and specialized metabolite MS profiles, generating protein MS hierarchical groupings that accurately mirrored phylogenetic groupings and further distinguishing isolates based on inter- and intra-species differences in specialized metabolite production. With the ease of use of modern MALDI instrumentation and interactive, intuitive data exploration, IDBac can rapidly profile up to 384 bacteria in 4 hours. To our knowledge, IDBac is the first attempt to couple in situ MS analyses of protein content and specialized metabolite production and will enable laboratories with access to a MALDI-TOF MS the ability to rapidly create more efficient libraries for their drug discovery programs.","tags":["University of Illinois"],"title":"IDBac: A New Paradigm in Developing Microbial Libraries for Drug Discovery","type":"publication"},{"authors":["Marianna Foos"],"categories":null,"content":"Unfortunately we do not currently have an abstract, copy of the slides or link to the video to this presentation\n","date":1534291200,"expirydate":-62135596800,"kind":"page","lang":"en","lastmod":1534291200,"objectID":"eb8cb3f44436993e731e1093573bec39","permalink":"/publication/rinpharma_1/","publishdate":"1999-01-01T00:00:00Z","relpermalink":"/publication/rinpharma_1/","section":"publication","summary":"Unfortunately we do not currently have an abstract, copy of the slides or link to the video to this presentation","tags":["Biogen"],"title":"Keeping things Peachy when Shiny gets Hairy","type":"publication"},{"authors":["Ed Lauzier"],"categories":null,"content":"","date":1534291200,"expirydate":-62135596800,"kind":"page","lang":"en","lastmod":1534291200,"objectID":"ecd7f3064e5ca98b92bfd80125c0b111","permalink":"/publication/rinpharma_18/","publishdate":"1999-01-01T00:00:00Z","relpermalink":"/publication/rinpharma_18/","section":"publication","summary":"The dramatic increase of R in the computational, analytics, and data science areas has led to some innovative techniques in recent years for interactive analytics.

However, especially the treatment of life-threatening disease such as cancer requires a good understanding of benefit and associated risks to make an informed therapy decision for an individual patient. Recently approved immunotherapeutic drugs in oncology are associated with potential side effects such as immune-related hypothyroidism, rash and colitis. There is some biological reasoning that the occurrence of immune-related adverse events and corresponding management may compromise the drug response. On the other hand, it has been observed that patients responding to treatment might face a higher likelihood of adverse drug reactions. A multi-state model is able to explore these hypotheses and offers the opportunity of insights into potential associations while addressing some of the methodological challenges. For example, the necessity of a time-dependent approach to accommodate the fact that safety and efficacy events can occur throughout the treatment. Moreover, longer treatment duration can impact simultaneously the likelihood of efficacy as well as safety events, i.e., introducing immortal time bias. The multistate model is able to unfold this spurious correlation.

A translation of this model (155 parameters and 26 compartments) using R and the open-source mrgsolve package2 provided an efficient platform for multi-parameter optimization, as required during additional model development and for subsequent simulations. For comparison, a 8.62 seconds simulation with viral and bacterial infections (no interventions) in the R/mrgsolve implementation required 226 seconds in Matlab. Model translation to R also enabled simulations with a Shiny App, allowing users to simulate individual infant phenotypes and infection events and visualize growth and energy levels over time, relative to healthy (WHO) standards. The model currently also includes a relatively simple implementation of persistent antibiotic therapy with a potential for inclusion of drug exposure-related effects, i.e. - through a pharmacokinetic (PK) model, to describe effects of antiviral or antibiotic therapy. The challenge to this development is the scarcity of available data describing this therapy in malnourished children that would be needed for model calibration.
