      <description>&lt;h2 id=&#34;rpharma-2023-keynotes&#34;&gt;R/Pharma 2023 Keynotes&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;R/Pharma is excited to announce our keynote speakers for 2023.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h2 id=&#34;dionne-price&#34;&gt;Dionne Price&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Our Impact in the Evolving Data Landscape&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;br&gt;
Data sources and the volume of data available for driving discovery and informing decisions have substantially increased over time. This increase has resulted in an evolving data and regulatory landscape ripe for the expertise of statisticians and data scientists. Statisticians and data scientists must play a key role to ensure the appropriate use of data and soundness of conclusions reached from analyses of the data. In this talk, we will explore the landscape identifying challenges and opportunities and highlight our contributions and impact.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h4 id=&#34;bio&#34;&gt;Bio&lt;/h4&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Dionne Price is the Deputy Director of the Office of Biostatistics in the Office of Translational Sciences, Center for Drug Evaluation and Research, FDA. In this role, Dr. Price provides leadership to statisticians involved in the development and application of methodology used in the regulation of drug products. She currently leads cross-cutting, collaborative efforts across FDA to advance and facilitate the use of innovative trial designs in pharmaceutical drug development. Dr. Price received her MS in Biostatistics from the University of North Carolina at Chapel Hill and a PhD in Biostatistics from Emory University. Dr. Price is an active member of the American Statistical Association (ASA) and the Eastern North American Region of the International Biometrics Society. She is a Fellow of the ASA and the 2023 President of the ASA.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h2 id=&#34;james-black&#34;&gt;James Black&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;The importance of the SCE in enabling our shift from proprietary programming to open-source data science&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;br&gt;
Historically building a great SCE for clinical reporting involved selecting a vendor, integrating their product, and supporting a single proprietary language. The shift to report clinical trials using R has had a much broader impact than just swapping out a language, with it also catalysing the adoption of data science in statistical programming. For the team building the latest generation of SCEs, this has led to a complex eco-system of dynamic dependencies to enable reproducible research, the need to adapt to a much faster pace of development of the tools used, and facilitated bringing different elements of evidence generation like trial design, and real world evidence, to co-exist with statistical programming. During this talk, we&amp;rsquo;ll discuss this evolution, the underlying tensions we continue to tackle aspiring to balance innovation against business continuity, and the critical role SCE architecture plays facilitating a shift to data science.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h4 id=&#34;bio-1&#34;&gt;Bio&lt;/h4&gt;
&lt;p&gt;James Black gained his PhD from Cambridge University, with a thesis focussed on analysing the effect of randomising type 2 diabetes patients to different CVD risk management guidelines. After grad school he joined Roche&amp;rsquo;s real world data team, where he was a key driver in their rapid shift from using SAS and file shares to R, databases and git. Currently he leads Insights Engineering in Roche Pharma Product Development, and is the Product Owner for the PHC/RWE and Clinical Trial Reporting Scientific Computing Environments. He is also involved in Open Source and industry collaborations, sitting on the board of Open Source in Pharma, the R Consortium Pharma Oversight working group, PhUSE&amp;rsquo;s SCE Council and is the Product Development representative for Roche&amp;rsquo;s internal Open and Inner Source office.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h2 id=&#34;daniel-sabanés-bové&#34;&gt;Daniel Sabanés Bové&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Why we Need to Improve Software Engineering in Biostatistics - A Call to Action&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;br&gt;
Programming is ubiquitous in applied biostatistics, and most statisticians know a programming language such as R - yet software engineering is still neglected as a skill and undervalued as a profession in pharmaceutical statistics. Why is this a problem? Importantly, we run the risk of wrong decisions when relying on code that we wrote ourselves without any code review by other statisticians. When transitioning over undocumented code to successors or other teams, we cannot be sure that they can even use, yet maintain it in the future at all. Also, whether they can reproduce results we produced earlier is a matter of luck. If we later need to add features to our code, and don&amp;rsquo;t have sufficient tests in place, we will undoubtedly introduce bugs and alter the program behavior without knowing it. Finally, if we need to implement new statistical methods for analyses submitted to regulators, we need to have appropriate software validation pipelines in place, which will demand well developed and tested code. What can we do about it? First and foremost, we must become aware of the problem. Second, we need to take software engineering seriously, starting from education in basic software engineering skills - across schools, universities, and during the work life. Establishing dedicated software engineering teams within academic institutions and companies can be a key factor for the establishment of good software engineering practices and catalyze improvements across research projects. Providing attractive career paths is important for the retainment of talents. Finally, collaboration between software developers from different organizations is key to harness open-source software efficiently and optimally, while building trusted solutions. We illustrate the potential with examples of successful projects.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h4 id=&#34;bio-2&#34;&gt;Bio&lt;/h4&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Daniel Sabanes Bove studied Statistics in LMU Munich and obtained his PhD at the University of Zurich for his research work on Bayesian model selection. He started his career in 2013 at Roche as a biostatistician, then worked at Google as a data scientist from 2018 to 2020 before rejoining Roche. He is currently leading the Statistical Engineering team in Roche Pharma Product Development that works on productionizing R packages, Shiny modules and how-to templates for data scientists. Daniel is co-author of multiple R packages published on CRAN and Bioconductor, as well as the book &amp;ldquo;Likelihood and Bayesian Inference: With Applications in Biology and Medicine&amp;rdquo;, and is currently co-chairing openstatsware, a working group focusing on Software Engineering in biostatistics.&lt;/p&gt;

      <title>R/Pharma Round Tables</title>
      <link>/post/2023-09-16-summit/</link>
      <pubDate>Sat, 16 Sep 2023 00:00:00 +0000</pubDate>
      <guid>/post/2023-09-16-summit/</guid>
      <description>&lt;p&gt;We&amp;rsquo;re just a couple of days out from the R/Pharma round tables!&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;With the help of an advisory board spanning Amgen, BeiGene, Genentech, GSK, The Janssen Pharmaceutical Companies of Johnson &amp;amp; Johnson, Novartis, Pfizer, The Prostate Cancer Clinical Trials Consortium (PCCTC), Roche and Posit PBC the following topics are now on the agenda for our round tables (our attempt at paraphrasing these nuanced topics):&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;ul&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Can we stop validating R packages internally, and build a pan-industry process?&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;How can we help the path to interactive regulatory submissions?&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;What&amp;rsquo;s needed to be more confident depending on externally governed packages?&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Can we combine our learnings on making a case for OS contributions?&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Where is the potential for impact with LLMs/AA/AI for both drug development, and data scientist efficiency?&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Where are we as data scientists and SCE developers on multi-modal, multi-disciplinary, drug development?&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;
&lt;p&gt;and probably the topic we are most excited about (especially with Roche and others attending, to discuss its SCE for CT/RWE and PHC) is&amp;hellip;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;ul&gt;
&lt;li&gt;What is a modern workflow?  What are the key capabilities of a modern SCE?  What can we learn from each other enabling diversity without compromising our SCE architecture - from legacy codebases/languages and their workflows built around mounted drives and unix permissions, through to multi-modal analyses querying multiple data stores via tokens as secrets, mixing not just open source languages, but different dockerfiles in a single analysis.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;
&lt;p&gt;70 representatives from 42 companies will come together to tackle these and other questions.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Review the agenda below, or visit the discussion link to see the proposed topics:&lt;/p&gt;

      <description>&lt;p&gt;There is much excitement for R/Pharma 2023! Please find below the plan for the gathering!&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Based on the 2022 conference feedback, it is clear people are keen to get back together in person, as we did at Harvard in 2018 and 2019. Moreover, people very much like our virtual gathering and the accessibility for all people across the world.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Our 2023 plan is to have in-person and virtual components, as detailed below!&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h2 id=&#34;in-person&#34;&gt;In-Person&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;R/Pharma is excited to announce that we are partnering with Posit to host our in-person program at posit::conf(2023), happening at the Hyatt Regency Chicago from Sunday, September 17 through Wednesday, September 20, 2023.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The in-person R/Pharma program at posit::conf(2023) will focus on the future of drug development using open source. The collaboration will include two activities specific to the pharmaceutical industry: (1) the &lt;strong&gt;&amp;ldquo;R/Pharma Roundtable Summit&amp;rdquo;&lt;/strong&gt; for program leaders and people leading Open Source initiatives, and (2) the &lt;strong&gt;&amp;ldquo;Leveraging And Contributing To The Pharmaverse For Clinical Trial Reporting In R&amp;rdquo;&lt;/strong&gt; workshop for data professionals.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Please register via the R/Pharma link: &lt;a href=&#34;https://pos.it/pharmasummit&#34;&gt;https://pos.it/pharmasummit&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Over the last five years, we&amp;rsquo;ve seen explosive growth in the use of R and other open-source technologies across drug development, with an increasing focus on open-source projects and pan-company collaboration. During the flagship event, the R/Pharma Roundtable Summit, facilitators will foster in-person discussions and conversations about key items (reproducibility, submissions, scalability, etc.) with industry leaders about open-source tools for next-generation submissions. R Validation Hub lead, Doug Kelhlkof (Roche), will lead a 90-minute workshop on a new validated repository for GxP R use. For the reminder of the day, R/Pharma and Posit will facilitate talks and discussions around open source drug development topics relevant to participating attendees. You can find a sample agenda for the R/Pharma Roundtable Summit here:&lt;/p&gt;

      <description>&lt;p&gt;We are excited to announce that the R/Pharma 2022 conference and workshop recordings are now available for viewing! If you were not able to attend the conference live, or wish to re-watch the talks, you can find all of the videos on the &lt;a href=&#34;https://www.youtube.com/@RinPharma&#34; target=&#34;_blank&#34; rel=&#34;noopener&#34;&gt;R/Pharma YouTube Channel&lt;/a&gt; with the following playlists:&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;li&gt;&lt;a href=&#34;https://www.youtube.com/playlist?list=PLMtxz1fUYA5D7_dke-o71AA_DqyV-WpXA&#34; target=&#34;_blank&#34; rel=&#34;noopener&#34;&gt;Day 2 presentations&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/li&gt;

&lt;/ul&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The conference was a huge success with an amazing lineup of speakers, including the co-creator of the R language &lt;a href=&#34;https://computationalbiomed.hms.harvard.edu/about/people/robert-gentleman-phd/&#34; target=&#34;_blank&#34; rel=&#34;noopener&#34;&gt;Robert Gentleman&lt;/a&gt;!&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;/div&gt;

&lt;p&gt;That&amp;rsquo;s not all &amp;hellip; Like in previous years, the R/Pharma Conference offered a terrific lineup of workshops covering many innovative approaches to using R and other open source software in analysis pipelines and application development. You can view the workshop recordings on the &lt;a href=&#34;https://www.youtube.com/playlist?list=PLMtxz1fUYA5AWYQHB5mZAs-yamNJ5Tm_8&#34; target=&#34;_blank&#34; rel=&#34;noopener&#34;&gt;R/Pharma 2022 Workshop Playlist&lt;/a&gt;. Be sure to view the description of the workshop video for resources shared during the workshops.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;R/Pharma would not be possible without the talented members of our organizing and program committees, workshop instructors, presenters, and the life-sciences community. We hope you enjoy the recordings and look forward to our events in 2023!&lt;/p&gt;

      <title>Meet the R/Pharma Conference Platform</title>
      <link>/post/2022-10-26-platform/</link>
      <pubDate>Wed, 26 Oct 2022 00:00:00 +0000</pubDate>
      <guid>/post/2022-10-26-platform/</guid>
      <description>&lt;p&gt;For the third year we have chosen to use the &lt;a href=&#34;https://hopin.com/&#34; target=&#34;_blank&#34; rel=&#34;noopener&#34;&gt;hopin&lt;/a&gt; conference platform to host R/Pharma.  Here is a brief guide to some of the platform&amp;rsquo;s features.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;TL;DR - &lt;a href=&#34;https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=EOlWYsnE3JU&#34; target=&#34;_blank&#34; rel=&#34;noopener&#34;&gt;watch this video&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;When you enter hopin you&amp;rsquo;ll be in the reception area.  This is one of five main areas within the conference platform, each will be described briefly below.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h2 id=&#34;reception&#34;&gt;Reception&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The page you see when you first enter the conference.  It&amp;rsquo;s a place where the conference organizers can push important announcements and where you&amp;rsquo;ll be able to see the schedule.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h2 id=&#34;stage&#34;&gt;Stage&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;This is the place where all of the talks happen.  Head over to the stage to listen to the speakers and watch the panels.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h2 id=&#34;sessions&#34;&gt;Sessions&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Sessions is an area for smaller talks, round-tables and discussions with up to 50 on camera and an audience of up to 5000.  Not only can we schedule sessions throughout the conference, but you can create them too.  We&amp;rsquo;ve left sessions open for impromptu meetings.  Anyone can create a session by just clicking on &lt;strong&gt;Create Session&lt;/strong&gt;, filling in a few details and adding an optional picture.&lt;br&gt;
Sessions can be open, meaning anyone can go on camera, or moderated, meaning that you can manage who goes on camera.  Anyone and everyone can watch sessions.  Want to follow up with a speaker?  Invite them to a session over a virtual coffee!&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h2 id=&#34;people&#34;&gt;People&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Here you can find people at the conference by searching for, and connecting with, other attendees.  You can also try speed-networking where you&amp;rsquo;ll be randomly paired with another conference attendee for three minutes and both go on camera.  It&amp;rsquo;s a great way to meet new people, and we all have something in common!  Please consider trying it out - you&amp;rsquo;ll find that everyone at R/Pharma is very nice!&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h2 id=&#34;expo&#34;&gt;Expo&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The expo is our virtual exhibition hall.  R/Pharma does not work with sponsors and we promote open source so the exhibition hall is not a traditional one.  We&amp;rsquo;re using this space to give people a chance to showcase their R packages and shiny apps.  When you enter a booth you can see a video or set of slides highlighting a package or app.&lt;br&gt;
If  the author is present in the booth they can interact with you and even show a live demo.  The expo will be open throughout the entire three days of the conference - come check it out.&lt;br&gt;
If you would like to showcase your package or app more details are in this &lt;a href=&#34;/post/2022-10-16-expo/&#34;&gt;blog post&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h5 id=&#34;rpharma-aims-to-provide-amazing-workshops-and-presentations-within-a-highly-social-atmosphere--this-is-clearly-more-challenging-in-a-virtual-environment--we-hope-you-enjoy-the-conference-and-have-the-chance-to-make-some-new-connections&#34;&gt;R/Pharma aims to provide amazing workshops and presentations within a highly social atmosphere.  This is clearly more challenging in a virtual environment.  We hope you enjoy the conference and have the chance to make some new connections.&lt;/h5&gt;

      <title>Some entertainment between talks</title>
      <link>/post/2022-10-26-entertainment/</link>

      <guid>/post/2022-10-26-entertainment/</guid>
      <description>&lt;p&gt;At R/Pharma we know it&amp;rsquo;s important to take regular breaks during a virtual event.  We try to make these breaks fun and are excited to introduce you to three friends of R/Pharma who will be providing some entertainment this year.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h2 id=&#34;rafael-de-andrade-moral&#34;&gt;Rafael De Andrade Moral&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Rafael De Andrade Moral is a lecturer in Statistics at Maynooth University. He holds a BSc in Biology and a PhD in Statistics from University of São Paulo, Brazil. He really enjoys teaching and doing research related to the development of statistical modelling techniques applied to Ecology, Wildlife Management, Agriculture and Environmental Science. He is also interested in the computational implementation of statistical models, especially in R. He has recently founded the Theoretical and Statistical Ecology Group (&lt;a href=&#34;https://tsecolgroup.wordpress.com&#34;&gt;https://tsecolgroup.wordpress.com&lt;/a&gt;) and since 2020 has been producing musical parodies to teach Statistics (&lt;a href=&#34;http://tinyurl.com/rafamoral&#34; target=&#34;_blank&#34; rel=&#34;noopener&#34;&gt;http://tinyurl.com/rafamoral&lt;/a&gt;). In his spare time he enjoys playing guitar and writing music, as well as performing magic tricks. Last, but not least, he loves German Shepherd dogs!&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h2 id=&#34;lodge-mccammon&#34;&gt;Lodge McCammon&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Lodge McCammon is a humorist, instructional designer, author, musician, and international education consultant. He works with school districts, universities, nonprofits, and businesses (e.g., Discovery Education, Microsoft, SAS, The Coca-Cola Company). He has given his unique keynote speeches at events like the Midwest Education Technology Conference, the University of the West Indies Open Lecture, and Amazon’s Series on Remote Learning. Lodge also creates custom content for meetings and events like the R/Pharma Conference.

&lt;h2 id=&#34;mike-smith&#34;&gt;Mike Smith&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Mike K. Smith is the lead of the R Centre of Excellence at Pfizer. He trained as a statistician, and after a period working in the Pharmacometrics modelling and simulation group he returned back to the Statistics organisation. He describes himself as a professional geek at work, and this label works equally well for his musical output. Mike likes to use randomness and probability in making music, which can be labelled as generative ambient music. You can think of it as soundtracks and textures for films and pictures that don’t exist. He makes music as MikeKSmith and his released music can be found on Bandcamp at &lt;a href=&#34;https://mikeksmith.bandcamp.com/&#34;&gt;https://mikeksmith.bandcamp.com/&lt;/a&gt; with “work in progress” on SoundCloud at &lt;a href=&#34;https://soundcloud.com/mikeksmith&#34;&gt;https://soundcloud.com/mikeksmith&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;

      <title>R/Pharma 2022 Expo</title>
      <link>/post/2022-10-16-expo/</link>
      <pubDate>Sun, 16 Oct 2022 00:00:00 +0000</pubDate>
      <guid>/post/2022-10-16-expo/</guid>
      <description>&lt;h3 id=&#34;calling-all-opensource-developers-come-show-off-your-packages-and-shiny-apps&#34;&gt;Calling all opensource developers! Come Show off your packages and shiny apps!&lt;/h3&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Do you have an R package or shiny app that you want to showcase at R/Pharma?&lt;br&gt;
We are excited to announce that R/Pharma 2022 will feature a virtual exposition hall which will give you the opportunity to showcase an R package or shiny app in a virtual booth.  The expo will be open throughout the entire three day conference event, running continuously so that attendees can see your package/app during breaks and down time.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;ul&gt;
&lt;li&gt;You can run a video or slideshow for attendees to see when they click on your booth
&lt;ul&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Suggestion - a video of your app in use or a series of screen captures&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;
&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;When you are present at your booth you can video chat with visitors or show a live demo
&lt;ul&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Please note - we won&amp;rsquo;t be including specific times in the schedule for people to come to the Expo&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;You can schedule a demo and invite other attendees (simply announce that you&amp;rsquo;ll be demoing at a particular time on the conference chat).&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;
&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Each booth has its own dedicated chat window where attendees can post questions/comments&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;&lt;strong&gt;We&amp;rsquo;ll do all the virtual booth set-up work for you&lt;/strong&gt;
&lt;ul&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Just fill in this &lt;a href=&#34;https://form.jotform.com/222836926208057&#34; target=&#34;_blank&#34; rel=&#34;noopener&#34;&gt;online form&lt;/a&gt; and we&amp;rsquo;ll take care of the rest&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;
&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;
&lt;div class=&#34;alert alert-note&#34;&gt;
  &lt;div&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;If you would like to include a virtual booth please fill out this &lt;a href=&#34;https://form.jotform.com/222836926208057&#34;&gt;form&lt;/a&gt;.  Be sure to have the following information available:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;ul&gt;
&lt;li&gt;General details of the app/package (name, one-line description and longer description)&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Two graphics, one small (a hexsticker is perfect) and one large (2:1 aspect ratio works best, a screenshot perhaps?)&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;A video (Youtube, Vimeo or Wista) or google slides to play in the booth.  This is what people will see when they come to the booth - it can be a recorded demonstration of the app, slides describing the package, etc.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;
  &lt;/div&gt;
&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Any questions?  Just reach out to us at &lt;a href=&#34;mailto:info@rinpharma.com&#34;&gt;info@rinpharma.com&lt;/a&gt; or through the contact form.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;More information on booths is available in this &lt;a href=&#34;https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=uXJ-a1CgLoI&#34; target=&#34;_blank&#34; rel=&#34;noopener&#34;&gt;short video&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;a href=&#34;https://form.jotform.com/222836926208057&#34; target=&#34;_blank&#34; class=&#34;btn btn-success px-2 py-2 mb-3&#34;&gt;Submit An Expo Booth&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Please note - No vendor or commercial products.  R/Pharma is committed to opensource&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

      <description>&lt;p&gt;We are pleased to announce R/Pharma 2022!!&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;R/Pharma 2022 will be held as a free virtual conference from November 8-10, 2022 with workshops running the week before.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;More details on keynote speakers and call-for-talks will follow shortly.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;R/Pharma 2020 and 2021 were huge successes as virtual events with over 2000 registrations for the 2021 event.  We decided to keep the 2022 conference virtual in order to include as many participants as possible.  For 2023 we are considering a hybrid event.&lt;/p&gt;

      <title>The what and the why for R/Pharma</title>
      <link>/post/thewhy/</link>
      <pubDate>Sat, 01 Aug 2020 00:00:00 +0000</pubDate>

      <description>&lt;h2 id=&#34;background&#34;&gt;Background&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;By design, R/Pharma is deliberately a smaller conference in terms of attendance in order to encourage maximum opportunities for direct interaction with speakers. In 2018 and 2019 the conference was held in the Tsai Auditorium at the Center for Government and International Studies, Harvard University and capped at 150 attendees. The conference was run as a free event. Invitations were based on committee membership and advisory support, speaker acceptance, academic/student and diversity.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The conference has been run with single track consisting of keynotes from renowned industry practitioners to key R developers to leading academics. In addition there were a number of pre-conference workshops and full-length presentations as well as a number of shorter, highly-energetic lightning talks.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;In 2020 we took a hiatus from holding the meeting at Harvard and ran a virtual conference. Over 1100 people registered for the three day virtual event that was preceded by a week of 11 workshops.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Following the success of the 2020 event the organizing committee decided to hold a virtual event for the 2021 meeting. 2000 people registered for the three day event which included three panel discussion groups on the areas of validation, training and leadership and scaling shiny. In addition, we held 14 workshops around the conference dates.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;In 2022 we will be running a virtual event again.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Our entire event is a community-lead effort and 100% volunteer run. The event is vendor neutral and very much an academic conference. Harvard has been very helpful in hosting the event.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The R/Pharma conference is an event focused on the use of R in the development of pharmaceuticals. The conference covers topics including reproducible research, regulatory compliance and validation, safety monitoring, clinical trials, drug discovery, research &amp;amp; development, PK/PD/pharmacometrics, genomics, diagnostics, immunogenicity and more. All are discussed within the context of using R as a primary tool within the drug development process. The conference showcases the current use of R that is helping to drive biomedical research, drug discovery &amp;amp; development, and clinical initiatives. (Note that topics related to the use of R in hospitals/clinics for patient care by clinicians, doctors, and researchers is the focus of R/Medicine.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;R/Pharma is dedicated to providing a harassment-free conference experience for everyone regardless of gender, sexual orientation, disability or any feature that distinguishes human beings.&lt;/p&gt;
