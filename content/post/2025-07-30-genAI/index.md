We're so excited to announce the lineup for the second **R/Pharma genAI day**, the single day event focused on examples of using generative artificial intelligence (GenAI) with an emphasis in the drug development space and clinical domain.

The virtual Single Day Event (August 19th) will be focused on various applications of GenAI such as accelerating the learning of open source languages and supporting late-stage reporting tasks. The day will consist of a workshop, talks, and a panel discussion/hangout.

Free registration: <https://events.zoom.us/ev/AhJgNAEgFp0gVZG2EFBctyctEm8CstaLIEhxRlQMdtnGW3kbCTuI~ArOl6K2ZzYqVlcryttKbAVtgnsvE6g6mByAhuOim9_vxpcQ-lh-mJvL1Ag>
