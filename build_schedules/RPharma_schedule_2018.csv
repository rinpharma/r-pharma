1,10:30 AM,talk,Using R in a GxP Environment,"The Data Science team in Pfizer’s Vaccine Research and Development division (VRD) creates and maintains validated applications used during high-throughput clinical testing that enable advanced analytic and reporting requirements. SAS has long been the de-facto standard for analyzing data in a regulated GxP environment. Web deployment of these applications has been the best approach, and Pfizer VRD has developed several mid-tier applications in Java that submit batch SAS processes on a High Performance Computing grid. Pfizer VRD’s high level approach is the same across different assay platforms: data are pulled from a combination of electronic files and Oracle databases and analyzed, results are written back to an Oracle database, and electronic output files are made in various formats (e.g. PDF). The regulated nature of Pfizer VRD’s work and the difficulty in deploying R-based applications over the web have previously been an impediment to the use of R, but new tools such as RStudio’s Shiny Server Pro have helped us overcome those challenges. This presentation focuses on a comparison of the architecture used to deploy our SAS applications and the infrastructure required to deploy R-based applications to meet GxP requirements. Real life examples will be provided to illustrate the usefulness of this platform in a regulated laboratory environment.",Boyd Gonnerman // John Sims // Frank DePierro  // Peter Giardina,Pfizer // Pfizer // Pfizer // Pfizer,https://github.com/rinpharma/2018_presentations/blob/master/talks_folder/2018-Gonnerman-R_in_a_GxP_Environment.pptx,
1,10:40 AM,talk,IDBac: A New Paradigm in Developing Microbial Libraries for Drug Discovery,"The success of a bacterial drug discovery program can be no greater than the phylogenetic diversity and capacity of those bacteria in the library to produce specialized metabolites (SM). However, the methods used to create bacterial strain libraries have seen little innovation in nearly 80 years. Current practice relies entirely on colony morphology and/or 16S rRNA gene sequencing analysis to decide which isolated strains to retain for addition to a drug discovery library. However, these practices create inefficient libraries plagued with a high degree of taxonomic and chemical redundancy by relying on physical characteristics that have limited correlation with strains’ SM, the foundation of drug discovery. Therefore, the development of a platform to rapidly prioritize unknown bacterial strains based on phylogeny and SM would greatly increase the efficiency of the front-end of microbial drug discovery. Our lab has recently developed such a platform, called IDBac, which uses in situ matrix-assisted laser desorption/ionization time-of-flight mass spectrometry (MALDI-TOF MS) to analyze protein and specialized metabolite spectra of single bacterial colonies. Utilizing R and Shiny, alongside state-of-the-art packages and techniques in MALDI processing and data visualization, we created a stand-alone executable program for MALDI-TOF MS bacterial analysis. Using unsupervised learning methods and visualizations we have demonstrated IDBac’s capabilities by creating protein and specialized metabolite MS profiles, generating protein MS hierarchical groupings that accurately mirrored phylogenetic groupings and further distinguishing isolates based on inter- and intra-species differences in specialized metabolite production. With the ease of use of modern MALDI instrumentation and interactive, intuitive data exploration, IDBac can rapidly profile up to 384 bacteria in 4 hours. To our knowledge, IDBac is the first attempt to couple in situ MS analyses of protein content and specialized metabolite production and will enable laboratories with access to a MALDI-TOF MS the ability to rapidly create more efficient libraries for their drug discovery programs.",Chase Clark,University of Illinois at Chicago,https://github.com/rinpharma/2018_presentations/blob/master/talks_folder/2018-Clark-IDBac.pdf,

1,11:40 AM,talk,Multi-state Model for the Analysis of an Association between Safety and Efficacy Events,"Safety and efficacy data in clinical trials are mostly analyzed separately. However, especially the treatment of life-threatening disease such as cancer requires a good understanding of benefit and associated risks to make an informed therapy decision for an individual patient. Recently approved immunotherapeutic drugs in oncology are associated with potential side effects such as immune-related hypothyroidism, rash and colitis. There is some biological reasoning that the occurrence of immune-related adverse events and corresponding management may compromise the drug response. On the other hand, it has been observed that patients responding to treatment might face a higher likelihood of adverse drug reactions. A multi-state model is able to explore these hypotheses and offers the opportunity of insights into potential associations while addressing some of the methodological challenges. For example, the necessity of a time-dependent approach to accommodate the fact that safety and efficacy events can occur throughout the treatment. Moreover, longer treatment duration can impact simultaneously the likelihood of efficacy as well as safety events, i.e., introducing immortal time bias. The multistate model is able to unfold this spurious correlation. We present an approach for analysis and exemplify the methodology with simulated data.",Juliane Manitz,EDM Serono,https://github.com/rinpharma/2018_presentations/blob/master/talks_folder/2018-Manitz-Association_between_Safety_and_Efficacy_Events.pdf,

1,1:40 PM,talk,Visualization methods for RNA-sequencing data analysis,"RNA-seq data is biased and accurate detection of differentially expressed genes (DEGs) is not a trivial task. While the data collection can be considered high-throughput, data analysis has intricacies that require careful human attention. The most effective approach to modern data analysis is to iterate between models and visuals, and to enhance the appropriateness of models based on feedback from visuals. As it stands, there is a need to make it easier for scientists and clinicians to use models and visuals in a complimentary fashion during RNA-seq data analysis. Here, we use public RNA-seq data to show that our visualization tools can detect normalization problems, DEG designation problems, and common errors in RNA-seq analysis. We also show that our tools can identify genes of interest that cannot be obtained with models. Through this project, we propose that users slightly modify their approach to data analysis by quickly assessing the sensibility of their models with statistical graphics. We plan to publish a new R software package that includes the plotting techniques introduced in this project, which can be useful for exploring several types of multivariate biological data such as RNA-sequencing data.",Lindsay Rutter,Iowa State University,,
1,1:50 PM,talk,The Use of R in the Development of Physiological Model for Healthy Growth,"A physiologically-based mathematical model was developed as a series of ordinary differential equations to describe compositional changes (in fat and fat-free mass, FM & FFM) due to metabolizable energy exchanges in babies from birth to 2 years in low-to-middle income countries.1 The objective of this work was to identify potential biomarkers for future intervention studies, identify when to intervene to protect and/or rescue growth in individuals suffering from malnutrition, and to identify which of these individuals would be more or less likely to respond to a nutritional intervention.
 A translation of this model (155 parameters and 26 compartments) using R and the open-source mrgsolve package2 provided an efficient platform for multi-parameter optimization, as required during additional model development and for subsequent simulations. For comparison, a 8.62 seconds simulation with viral and bacterial infections (no interventions) in the R/mrgsolve implementation required 226 seconds in Matlab. Model translation to R also enabled simulations with a Shiny App, allowing users to simulate individual infant phenotypes and infection events and visualize growth and energy levels over time, relative to healthy (WHO) standards.
 The model currently also includes a relatively simple implementation of persistent antibiotic therapy with a potential for inclusion of drug exposure-related effects, i.e. - through a pharmacokinetic (PK) model, to describe effects of antiviral or antibiotic therapy. The challenge to this development is the scarcity of available data describing this therapy in malnourished children that would be needed for model calibration. Further development of the model includes linking to other systems models such Mother-fetus energy exchange or PBPK mother-fetus models, to enable simulations of growth beginning at gestation.",Rena J.

1,2:00 PM,talk,Antibody Characterization Using Next Generation Sequencing made easier with Group My Abs shiny app,"Next-generation sequencing (NGS), phage display technology and high throughput capacities enables biologists in drug discovery to characterize antibodies (Abs) based on their HCDR3 sequences and further group them into families before moving to hit-to-lead stage of drug discovery and development. This enables diversification of Ab portfolio and insures back up options if Ab candidate fails. However, there was no method or software available in-house to support Ab discovery with capacities to apply biophysical rules to classify the sequences. 
 Shiny app ""Group My Abs"" was developed to apply biophysical properties for Ab characterization to the NGS data. Several Multiple Sequence Alignment algorithms implemented in the app enable sequence comparability. A method was developed to evaluate differences between comparable sequences and subsequently classify sequences into families. The app provides custom-made and interactive data visualization, enables refined Ab classification in a mathematical manner, considerably increases efficiency and insures reproducibility. This all decreases bias and enables informative decision making during the hit-to-lead stage in biologics drug discovery.",Volha Tryputsen,Janssen,https://github.com/rinpharma/2018_presentations/blob/master/talks_folder/2018-Tryputsen-Antibody_Characterization_NGS_Group_My_Abs.pdf,

At Novartis, Shiny and markdown have gained a lot of popularity in analyzing, visualizing and reporting of clinical trial data. Traditional report analysis plan (RAP) process was designed to create static table, figure and listings. In this talk, I will use ShinyRAP (a shiny app) to illustrate a novel framework/workflow of planning and executing of both pre-specified and ad-hoc analyses, as well as building dynamic/interactive reports through R/Shiny/Markdown. The app features efficient and organized programming through meta-data and shiny modules, and dynamic display of results via multi-select, grouping and searching, etc. Although motivated from a clinical trial data context, this framework can also be used for other types of data.",Xiao Ni,Novartis,,
1,3:55 PM,talk,Data-Driven Strategies for Synthetic Route Design and Operational Modeling within Pharmaceutical Development,"Decision analysis balancing both data analytics and human gut feeling is critical in designing efficient routes to synthesize new, complex small molecules. This challenge is faced by any organization seeking to deliver modern pharmaceutical compounds to patients in a prompt manner. In this presentation, we highlight the incorporation of data science approaches using R to develop metrics that aid in the development process: current complexity, risk quantification, and process efficiency forecasting. Current complexity is a metric established from human insights that assesses a molecule’s complexity in the context of capability, tracking the ‘current’ complexity of a given molecule over time and enabling the quantitative assessment of a new route or process. Risk quantification utilizes a Bayesian framework to quantify risk from real data and operational patterns, at both the project and portfolio level, for assessing the delivery risk of early candidate nomination assets in areas such as FTE resource modeling. Process efficiency can be estimated with a predictive analytics framework capable of quantifying the probable efficiency of a proposed synthesis or benchmarking the outcome performance of the developed process, thereby minimizing the environmental impact of pharmaceutical production. These strategies have been effectively used to aid the decision-making processes for pharmaceutical R&D.",Jun Li,BMS,,
1,4:05 PM,talk,Evaluating the performance of advanced causal inference methods applied to healthcare claims data,"Cohort studies of treatments developed from healthcare claims often have hundreds of thousands of patients and up to several thousand measured covariates. Therefore, new causal inference methods that combine ideas from machine learning and causal inference may improve analysis of these studies by taking advantage of the wealth of information measured in claims. In order to evaluate the performance of these methods as applied to claims-based studies, we use a combination of real data examples and plasmode simulation, implemented in R package ‘plasmode’, which creates realistic simulated datasets based on a real cohort study.

 therefore of paramount importance in infectious- and autoimmune diseases and cancer. Current state-of-the-art models developed by our group can with great precision model MHCI::p
 interactions. Using data from VDJdb and IEDB, we created an ensemble of convolutional neural networks, which to the best of our knowledge is the world’s first sequence based model capable
 of capturing the entire MHCI::p::TCR system. Due to limited data, we however currently can only model the interaction between the CDR3 region of the TCR’s beta chain with HLA-A*02:01 and 3
 peptides. However, as the model framework is easily extendable, we will increase the breadth and thus improve the model, as soon as more data become available. Using the current model and an
 independent test set, we obtained AUC = 0.747.

Designing your applications with an eye toward future expansion can save time and reduce human error in the long term.,Marianna Foos,Biogen,https://github.com/rinpharma/2018_presentations/blob/master/talks_folder/2018-Foos-Keeping_Things_Peachy_When_Shiny_Gets_Hairy.pptx,
2,4:05 PM,talk,Shiny Apps in Genomics and Clinical Trials,"R Shiny has revolutionized the way statisticians and analysts distribute analytic results and research methods. We can easily build interactive web tools that enhance data visualization and facilitate data and information sharing. Shiny apps can empower non-statisticians to explore and visualize their data or perform their own analyses with methods we develop. Harnessing this power, R users have developed Shiny apps for visualizing clinical trials and pharmaceutical data, as well as applications that aid in study design and analysis. I will present examples of how Shiny can be used in many stages of the drug development process and discuss the challenges as well as benefits of incorporating these tools in pharmaceutical workflows.",Jessica Minnier,Oregon Health & Science University,https://jminnier-talks.netlify.app/2018_08_rpharma_shiny/minnier_rpharma2018.html,
2,4:15 PM,talk,"R as the Core Technology to Support Modeling and Simulation in Pharma Research, Development, and Post Approval Activities","Since its foundation in 2004, Metrum Research Group has relied on R as the core technology and central framework for all of the company’s biomedical modeling and simulation (M&S) service activities, spanning more than 475 projects with 150+ different sponsors. Projects include pharmacokinetic-pharmacodynamic modeling, quantitative systems pharmacology models, simulation-based trial design evaluations, disease progression and patient population modeling, model-based meta analysis of competitor data, model-based comparative effectiveness assessments, and data management activities, etc., all within a regulated environment. Analyses were conducted in R or via other software tools which are managed via R scripts, functions, or packages. Key deliverables of M&S projects are routinely provided as R packages or interactive simulation applications, driven by R (and R Shiny). R has also been an essential component of Metrum’s vision for Open Science in biomedical M&S, allowing for accessibility and reproducibility of platform models developed for multiple disease areas.",Marc Gastonquay,Metrum Research Group,https://github.com/rinpharma/2018_presentations/blob/master/talks_folder/2018-Gastonguay-Modeling_and_Simulation_in_Pharma.pdf,
2,4:25 PM,talk,Building a community of competent developers and users of R-based tools in mass spectrometry-based research,"The R-based ecosystem, and its open-source methods for data manipulation, modeling and interpretation, is key for effective and reproducible research. This is certainly true in experiments relying on quantitative mass spectrometry. This relatively new and rapidly evolving field must overcome many sources of unwanted variation. It has many unsolved challenges, both in the appropriate use of the existing methods and tools, and in developing methods that address specialized problems. 
 This talk will illustrate our R-based efforts to promote sound statistical practice, and build a community of competent practitioners. First, we will present Cardinal, a comprehensive tool for quantitative mass spectrometry-based imaging, as well as MSstats, a general but flexible framework for mass spectrometry-based proteomics. We will highlight the importance of these tools for pharmaceutical research in an example of statistical characterization of therapeutic protein modifications. Second, we will detail our efforts of building a community of competent users through a world-wide series of short courses, intended for experimentalists and computational scientists alike.",Olga Vitek,Northeastern University,https://github.com/rinpharma/2018_presentations/blob/master/talks_folder/2018-Vitek-R_Based_Tools_in_Mass_Spectrometry_Research.pdf,
2,4:35 PM,talk,Bayesian Models for Smaller Trial Sizes,"Precision medicine typically refers to the development of drugs and other interventions for individual patients. But how do you assess efficacy and make predictions in this extreme small data regime?
 The Bayesian framework is ideal for this type of inference as it allows us to combine population and personal effects in a principled way and make predictions for both groups and individuals. The inferences are further improved when we introduce mechanistically inspired components into the modeling framework.
 I’ll talk about building pharma models in the small data regime and how we use Stan (a statistical modeling language for Bayesian inference) with R for analysis.",Daniel Lee,Generable,https://github.com/rinpharma/2018_presentations/blob/master/talks_folder/2018-Lee-Bayesian_models_for_smaller_trial_sizes.pdf,
2,4:45 PM,talk,Enhance R Overview,"Recruitment models for clinical trials are notoriously difficult to build due to many complex factors within a study. With input from experienced practitioners, we have built an interactive tool to allow individuals to build complex recruitment models using the R/Shiny framework. The Tool Enhance R, our platform for study modeling, was ported from an Excel-based tool to the R/Shiny platform to increase model development speed, expand capability and drive transparency into model development. The tool allows users to specify critical model attributes (i.e. country site distribution, recruitment/activation rates, country-specific vacations), and provide instantaneous feedback that changes have on a model’s probability of success. Using the RStudio Connect platform, we are able to grant multi-level access to users through a single web interface. Model development is tracked by exporting results to a SharePoint site and logging versions for future review/auditing. This gives significant levels of transparency on how a model was created and evolved over time. For web analytics, we used Piwik, and internal web analytics platform, to monitor how users navigate through the platform and identify browsing behavior. The application was built upon the Shiny Dashboard framework and leverages many visualization packages, including Plotly, Timevis, ggplot2 and many more. Many challenges arose in its develop, from controlling over-zealous user clicks causing out of control execution, to integrating service account execution of apps to facilitate centralized data control. This project pushed the limits of what the R/Shiny platform is capable of and demonstrates how data scientists can build useful solutions.",Jay Timmerman,Covance,https://github.com/rinpharma/2018_presentations/blob/master/talks_folder/2018-Timmerman-Enhance_R.pptx,
2,4:55 PM,talk,The Magic R-Shiny App that can Boost your SDTM Usability and Viability while Saving Time,"The United States Food and Drug Administration (FDA) requires that clinical trial data be submitted in the Study Data Tabulation Model (SDTM) standard format. The process of developing SDTM involves mapping captured raw data to their correspondent SDTM domains based on rules and conditions put by the Clinical Data Interchange Standards Consortium (CDISC) organization. SDTM data is further used for building the Analysis Data Model (ADaM) which is used for clinical trial statistical analysis. Mistakes in the mapping process are common due to the process complexities; issues that are missed may potentially affect the clinical trial result. Therefore, it is very essential to preserve the quality of the SDTM data. Currently, the main tool for checking SDTM conformance is Pinnacle21 (formerly known as OpenCDISC). Notably, there are usability and viability checks that are not included in Pinnacle21. This work describes the creation of an R shiny app to supplement the Pinnacle21 checks. This interactive app applies various CDISC-compliant SDTM data validation checks, and provides the user with a comprehensive report on possible inconsistencies in the data. The app would allow programmers to proactively find data mapping errors. In addition, it is straightforward to use and can save tremendous amounts of time. Additionally, this app’s audience extends beyond the programming community and covers other individuals who have an interest in data quality, particularly Data Managers and individuals in Clinical Science and Clinical Operations.",Elma Zannatul Ferdousy // Katrina Paz // Nasser Al Ali,Genentech // Genentech // Genentech,,
2,5:05 PM,talk,"Reproducible computational research at Eisai: leadership, technology, and culture","The pharmaceutical industry depends on accurate and reproducible data science for both preclinical and clinical analysis. Unfortunately, often an analysis cannot be reproduced and therefore its computational methodology and merit are unknown. Often, the data, code, or description of computational methods is not maintained. In order to implement good practices of reproducible computational research, the leadership of the company must invest time and resources into planning, training, ensuring adoption of common practices and tools, implementing documentation systems, encouraging discipline on the individual and group level, creating incentives, and requiring accountability. At Eisai, we have developed a working system for reproducible computational research that is enabled by leadership, technology, and culture. With regards to technology, we primarily use Rmarkdown and R Notebooks on an Rstudio server used by all our analysts. The Rstudio server is maintained by an administrator who installs packages for all users, creating a common package environment that ensures that code can be rerun in the future. Data and code are stored in a shared network drive and version control is accomplished by using Git. A wiki that is editable by all analysts is used to organize all analyses (tracked with unique analysis IDs) and provides links to code and results.
 With regards to culture, the leadership has promoted the values of quality and reproducibility. When yearly objectives are set, the performance criteria includes the creation of analysis documents (e.g. Rmarkdown reports), use of version control, and organization of data on shared network drives. Setting aside time for wiki documentation in the midst of high demands from project teams is helped by having periodic “documentation day” parties. To verify reproducibility, we have implemented ""witnessing"": once the analysis is finished, it is reviewed by an independent team member who officially signs off on the work, stating that the reproducibility criteria have been met. Our success in implementing reproducible computational research can serve as a model for other companies to use. Here we have provided a model based on leadership, technology, and culture.",Joseph Gerrein,Eisai,,
2,5:15 PM,talk,The Challenges of Validating R,"The first challenge in validating an analytic tool for the pharmaceutical industry is that, despite a formal FDA definition, there is still no cross-industry agreement on what 'validation' really means with respect to an analytic tool. AIMS (Application and Implementation of Methodologies in Statistics), a Special Interest Group within PSI have been attempting to answer this question with respect to R. In doing so we recently received approval from the R Consortium for an online R package validation repository and are now looking to formalise some early definitions. In this presentation I will walk through some of the challenges that we have identified thus far and outline what we're hoping to achieve with the platform.",Andy Nicholls,Glaxosmithkline,https://github.com/rinpharma/2018_presentations/blob/master/talks_folder/2018-Nicholls-The_Challenges_of_Validating_R.pptx,
