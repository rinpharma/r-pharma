There is much excitement for R/Pharma 2023! Please find below the plan for the gathering!

Based on the 2022 conference feedback, it is clear people are keen to get back together in person, as we did at Harvard in 2018 and 2019. Moreover, people very much like our virtual gathering and the accessibility for all people across the world.  

Our 2023 plan is to have in-person and virtual components, as detailed below!

## In-Person

R/Pharma is excited to announce that we are partnering with Posit to host our in-person program at posit::conf(2023), happening at the Hyatt Regency Chicago from Sunday, September 17 through Wednesday, September 20, 2023.

The in-person R/Pharma program at posit::conf(2023) will focus on the future of drug development using open source. The collaboration will include two activities specific to the pharmaceutical industry: (1) the **"R/Pharma Roundtable Summit"** for program leaders and people leading Open Source initiatives, and (2) the **"Leveraging And Contributing To The Pharmaverse For Clinical Trial Reporting In R"** workshop for data professionals.

Please register via the R/Pharma link: https://pos.it/pharmasummit

Over the last five years, we've seen explosive growth in the use of R and other open-source technologies across drug development, with an increasing focus on open-source projects and pan-company collaboration. During the flagship event, the R/Pharma Roundtable Summit, facilitators will foster in-person discussions and conversations about key items (reproducibility, submissions, scalability, etc.) with industry leaders about open-source tools for next-generation submissions. R Validation Hub lead, Doug Kelhlkof (Roche), will lead a 90-minute workshop on a new validated repository for GxP R use. For the reminder of the day, R/Pharma and Posit will facilitate talks and discussions around open source drug development topics relevant to participating attendees. You can find a sample agenda for the R/Pharma Roundtable Summit here:

This workshop will introduce participants to the pharmaverse, a collection of open source R packages that provide the next generation backbone for clinical trial reporting. In the workshop, participants will also create ADaM datasets, prepare tables and figures as well as interactive shiny apps.  You can find a sample agenda for the workshop here:
